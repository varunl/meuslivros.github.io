The latest draft of this specification can be found at <a class="ulink" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer-17">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer-17</a>.</p><p>These two specifications are still not final, it's safe to say they are stable, and there are already companies such as Salesforce.com and Ping Identity that have done practical implementations of them and are part of the specification development. These implementations are available and can be utilized by client application developers.</p><p>So, what are assertions?<a id="id392" class="indexterm"/> The Assertion Framework specification puts it this way:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>An assertion is a package of information that facilitates the sharing of identity and security information across security domains.</p></blockquote></div><p>This package of information is actually an XML security token. The assertion, in the form of statement, asserts security information about a subject and additionally defines conditions to these statements or to (the assertion) itself.</p><p>Main components of an assertion are statements, conditions, and the subject. For example, a SAML assertion can state that a user with the e-mail address <code class="literal">user@example.com</code> is part of the bloggers company group, and that the assertion itself is valid for a fixed period of time (defined with a starting and ending point).</p><p>There are three kinds of statements<a id="id393" class="indexterm"/> that can be defined in an assertion:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Authentication statements</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Attribute statements</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Authorization <a id="id394" class="indexterm"/>decision statements</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Other assertion based specifications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec52"/>Other assertion based specifications</h2></div></div></div><p>It is worth mentioning that, besides the OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles specification, another one is developed as well, referred to as OAuth JWT Assertion Profiles, which outlines the use of JSON Web Tokens <a id="id395" class="indexterm"/>for requesting access tokens and client authentication.</p><p>It is based on the same Assertion Framework specification and it's pretty similar in style; the latest draft can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-bearer-06">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-bearer-06</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>
