We learned that the data that is transmitted during the execution of a grant flow should be treated with security in mind. We learned about the features that are part of the OAuth 2.0 specification which are related to information security, and most importantly we learned which precautions should be taken into consideration.</p><p>OAuth 2.0 offers a wide array of available authorization grant types, and also allows defining new ones, which is useful when you need to integrate with some existing security protocol. Furthermore, OAuth 2.0 also allows defining additional authentication mechanisms.</p><p>In this chapter we will learn how to use SAML 2.0 assertions for adding additional security, either as a way of doing client authentication or as an authorization grant. More specifically, we will learn what an OAuth 2.0 assertion is, what SAML is all about, and how the access token grant and authentication are done with SAML 2.0 bearer assertion.</p><div class="section" title="SAML (2.0)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec39"/>SAML (2.0)</h1></div></div></div><p>

<a id="id387" class="indexterm"/> (<span class="strong"><strong>Security Assertion Markup Language</strong></span>), is an XML-based protocol that is used for exchanging authentication<a id="id388" class="indexterm"/> and authorization data for a given principal (usually an end user) between SAML identity providers and service providers.</p><p>SAML 2.0 <a id="id389" class="indexterm"/>mainly solves two requirements that are common in large enterprises:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Web-based single sign-on across multiple domains</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Federated identity</li></ul></div><p>The combination of using SAML and OAuth 2.0 together means leveraging SAML identity providers and providing easier integration in environments where SAML is already in use.</p></div></div></body></html>
