This chapter is important go to through before proceeding to later chapters.</p><p>Here, first we will learn which roles are defined in OAuth 2.0 and what is their purpose. After that are tokens, which types there are, and what they do. We'll also learn everything about the ones who are making the requests to the protected resources, the clients, and at the end of this chapter we'll learn about endpoints and access scope.</p><div class="section" title="Roles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec11"/>Roles</h1></div></div></div><p>Let's take a look at the<a id="id23" class="indexterm"/> following sentence: OAuth 2.0 provides authorization so that a client (for example, a mobile photo viewer application) can make authorized requests to protected resources on a service (for example, user's photographs on an online storage service) on behalf of the resource owner (for example, the user who uploaded the photos). We'll keep this in mind as an example while learning which roles there are in this chapter.</p><div class="section" title="Resource owner"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec12"/>Resource owner</h2></div></div></div><p>A resource owner is an<a id="id24" class="indexterm"/> entity who is capable of granting access to a protected resource. When this entity is a person the term <span class="strong"><strong>end user</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>user</strong></span> can be used as well.</p></div><div class="section" title="Authorization server"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec13"/>Authorization server</h2></div></div></div><p>In order for a client<a id="id25" class="indexterm"/> to access protected resources, this must first be authorized by the resource owner.</p><p>This is what the authorization server does&#x2014;it asks the user (resource owner) for confirmation that the client should be authorized to have access. For every successful authorization request, the server issues the client a so called 'access token.' It is a token that the client uses to specify for which user it is making the requests. Additionally, the issued token is specific to the authorized client application, so it can be said that the access token represents the relation between the authorization server, the client application, and the resource owner. Moreover, some other parameters are sent along with the access token, and we will check them out later in this chapter.</p></div><div class="section" title="Resource server"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec14"/>Resource server</h2></div></div></div><p>A resource server<a id="id26" class="indexterm"/> is the one who<a id="id27" class="indexterm"/> serves the protected resources, which are to be accessed by making authorized requests from a client application.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/5594OS_02_01.jpg" alt="Resource server"/></div><p>How the authorization and resource servers communicate is outside the scope of the OAuth 2.0 specification and therefore there are different implementations in the real world. They can be on separate servers, they can be on the same server, one authorization server can be used for several resource servers, and so on.</p></div><div class="section" title="Client"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec15"/>Client</h2></div></div></div><p>A client<a id="id28" class="indexterm"/> is an application that makes requests to protected resources on the resource server, on behalf of the resource owner (the user).</p><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>client application</strong></span>
<a id="id29" class="indexterm"/> can be a web application, desktop application, mobile application, and so on. The OAuth 2.0 specification does not impose limitations regarding the environment on which the client application should run.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"/>Tip</h3><p>From OAuth 2.0 's point of view it's important to associate the term client with the client application, and<a id="id30" class="indexterm"/> the term user with the resource owner, and not to mix them (here they are not interchangeable).</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
