Applications that are mainly written in JavaScript and the code they contain is downloaded in the browser before its execution.</p><p>These applications may look and behave the same as traditional web server applications, but the fact that everything they need is first downloaded to the client (for example, the browser) makes them unable to keep some data confidential, if required.</p><p>Moreover, these types of applications are mostly created for the read-only scenarios and use cases. The reason is that the access token is public, and someone can obtain it and takes damaging actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying or deleting some of his data.</p><div class="section" title="Implicit grant"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec23"/>Implicit grant</h1></div></div></div><p>OAuth 2.0 provides a grant flow<a id="id189" class="indexterm"/> specifically for client applications that are considered to be public clients (meaning unable to keep their credentials such as the client identifier and client secret in confidentiality) and it's called the implicit grant.</p><p>The main difference between the authorization code grant and implicit grant is that instead of using two requests&#x2014;one for an authorization code and then another one for obtaining the access token with it&#x2014;it makes one request and the client gets an access token as a result of the authorization request.</p><p>The characteristics of the<a id="id190" class="indexterm"/> implicit grant type are stated as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Used in public clients</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It's is a redirection-based flow (similar to the one in the authorization code grant)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The access token is received as a parameter of the redirection endpoint upon successful completion of the request, similar to the authorization code parameter in the authorization request response in the authorization code grant</li></ul></div><p>The following diagram shows a<a id="id191" class="indexterm"/> graphical representation of the flow, taken from the OAuth 2.0 specification:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/5594OS_05_01.jpg" alt="Implicit grant"/></div><p>The flow consists <a id="id192" class="indexterm"/>of the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">The first step is initiation of the flow. The client redirects the <span class="strong"><strong>User agent</strong></span> to the <span class="strong"><strong>Authorization server</strong></span> by using the authorization endpoint, the client identifier, and the redirection endpoint that will be used for the response.</li><li class="listitem">The <span class="strong"><strong>Authorization server</strong></span> authenticates the <span class="strong"><strong>Resource owner</strong></span> and requests his decision whether to authorize or deny the request.</li><li class="listitem">If the <span class="strong"><strong>Resource owner</strong></span> authorizes the request (which is assumed), he is redirected back with response information, using the supplied redirection endpoint that was provided with the initial request. The response information is contained in the URL fragment that contains the access token and other parameters (we'll see the difference between a regular URL parameter and one found in a URL fragment in the detailed overview).</li><li class="listitem">Now that the <span class="strong"><strong>User agent</strong></span> (the browser) is redirected back, the access token included in the response is passed to the <span class="strong"><strong>Client application</strong></span>.</li></ol></div><p>Regarding revoking tokens, the resource owner (the end user) usually will be provided with some web interface by the service provider where, when logged in, he can list and review which client <a id="id193" class="indexterm"/>applications he has authorized and optionally revoke access if required. This is the same as in the case with the authorization code grant.</p></div></div></body></html>
