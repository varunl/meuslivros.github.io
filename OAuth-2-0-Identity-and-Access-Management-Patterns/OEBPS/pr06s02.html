The latest Java JDK 6 will execute the examples just fine, but an update to the newest one is recommended because updates for this version are no longer provided. Another important thing to mention is that, when installing the JDK, the Java browser plugin is not required and doesn't have to be installed. Additionally, a source code editor (for example, Notepad++, Geany, jEdit, or any other) for editing and browsing the examples is needed.</p></div></body></html>
