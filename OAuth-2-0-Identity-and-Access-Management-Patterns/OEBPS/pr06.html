From securing service APIs to providing an easy to use sign-in mechanism, it provides a protection layer for the assets of the users so that various third party applications cannot have direct access to them. From service providers such as Amazon and social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to various internal enterprise solutions, OAuth 2.0 is often the authorization standard of choice.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>OAuth 2.0 Identity and Access Management Patterns</em></span> is a practical and informative book that will help you learn what OAuth 2.0 is, how to handle and implement various authorization flows for the chosen type of application, which security precautions to take into consideration, and so on.</p><p>You will explore each type of application such as web, client side, desktop, and so called trusted applications, and will see how to implement various authorization grant flows for each type of application. You will explore practical code examples that are executable as standalone applications running on top of Spring MVC. You will learn about the security features that are part of OAuth 2.0, what information that is transmitted during the execution of a flow is to be protected, and which precautions can be made. You will also learn how to use SAML 2.0 assertions in order to provide additional security. In the end, you will also learn which tools and libraries are there for the popular programming languages that provide support for integration with OAuth 2.0.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
