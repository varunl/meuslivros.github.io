These resources may vary from various data that the user has stored, to various <span class="strong"><strong>application programming interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>API</strong></span>) <a id="id0" class="indexterm"/>methods for system maintenance and more. The client applications, in order to obtain these protected resources, make HTTP requests to the predefined service endpoints and supply an access token&#x2014; a token that says which user has approved the client application to access its data. OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that has found its place as an authorization framework in various services that are provided to clients, most commonly securing RESTful APIs and web-based applications. Additionally, when businesses want to communicate to other businesses purely by exchanging resources via services in a B2B manner, OAuth 2.0 can be used.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p>The OAuth 2.0 specification is fully named "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework". It outlines the OAuth 2.0 protocol and leaves some points to be flexible and implemented in various ways; that's why it is important not to confuse it with a framework as in a technology stack; the term framework here means that the protocol can be implemented in various ways.</p></div></div><p>There are more cases, but what is evident is that OAuth 2.0 is able to handle the authorization layer in systems, providing access to protected resources in various scenarios, environments, and devices. Additionally, when it provides access, it does that on behalf of someone (most commonly the resource owner)&#x2014;who is identified by the access token. But more details later.</p><p>More and more enterprises started using OAuth 1.0 and migrated to OAuth 2.0, from payment services such as PayPal and service providers such as Amazon to social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and various internal enterprise solutions. It's used in various scenarios, from securing service APIs to providing an easy-to-use sign-in mechanism and more. What we can notice is that OAuth 2.0 is found in enterprises in two ways: they use it and/or they support it. When enterprises consume protected resources from other service providers that are secured with OAuth 2.0, we say they use it (they may do the same internally between their own systems). Additionally, when enterprises secure their own services with OAuth 2.0 or provide OAuth-based solutions so that other enterprises can secure their services, we say they support it.</p><div class="section" title="Why OAuth 2.0?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Why OAuth 2.0?</h1></div></div></div><p>As the usage increased,<a id="id1" class="indexterm"/> developers ran into some common problems during the implementation phase, for both service providers and client applications. In OAuth 1.0, the use of cryptographic functions are a part of the protocol, which adds to the difficulty of the developers implementing it. Later on a security flaw was discovered, which had to be resolved, and resulted in a revised specification named OAuth 1.0a. Previous specifications also had a bad design decision. The use of <span class="strong"><strong>Secure Sockets Layer</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SSL</strong></span>)<a id="id2" class="indexterm"/> in order to secure data transfer between the parties that are part of the authorization flow was not mandatory, which meant sensitive information could be exposed.</p><p>Additionally, there were use cases that were not defined and could have been like the various authorization flows that are part of OAuth 2.0. It was evident that improvements could be made to the original OAuth 1.0 specification.</p><p>Development took off to define a new revised specification, versioned 2.0, authored by a bigger team and based on their experience in OAuth 1.0 implementations and deployments, on comments from the wider community, and on the additional OAuth 1.0 based specifications that were created meanwhile (and had the common goal of adding additional capabilities that were needed but not available in OAuth 1.0).</p><p>This resulted in the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework, delivering key improvements especially by simplifying and defining more clearly the way client developers should implement authorization against providers, in order to access protected resources.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>OAuth 2.0 is not backwards compatible with 1.0, as they don't share a lot of similarities in implementation details, and they differ in the structure of exchanged information.</p></div></div><p>Therefore, developers that have worked with OAuth 1.0 should not make assumptions about OAuth 2.0 without getting familiar with it in the first place. Implementations for both 1.0 and 2.0 can co-exist for a given provider if it is chosen to support both, due to legacy clients, for example.</p><p>Support from service providers is leaning towards OAuth 2.0. A rough estimate of the percentage between providers that support OAuth 2.0 compared to OAuth 1.0 shows that at least 60 percent are in favor of OAuth 2.0. Some exclusively support OAuth 2.0 (a notable example of<a id="id3" class="indexterm"/> this is Facebook with its Graph API), some support OAuth 2.0 and announced deprecation of OAuth 1.0 (for example, Google), and some service providers support both versions.</p></div></div></body></html>
