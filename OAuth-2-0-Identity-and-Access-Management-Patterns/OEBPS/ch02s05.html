With scopes the client limits itself from all the resources that are available and this is a good security practice. When the request is processed, the authorization server validates the scope that is requested, and if it's invalid the client application won't get an access token. It is also very common for service providers to allow end users to review which scopes will be allowed upon granting the request.</p><p>Scope is an optional parameter and it's up to the implementation scenario what values it will have. There are some services such as the ones from Google that demand that scope is a mandatory parameter when making requests to their endpoints. Here, scope is used as a way to tell Google two things: which API services are requested and what is the degree of access requested<a id="id85" class="indexterm"/> for each one of them.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip05"/>Tip</h3><p>When developing a client application against a third party service to check which scopes are available, always search for developer documentation and guides supplied.</p></div></div><p>In services where scope<a id="id86" class="indexterm"/> is optional, if the client doesn't specify one, the OAuth 2.0 specification mandates that a default scope should be used. For every token there is always a scope in which it is set to operate, whether or not it was specified.</p></div></body></html>
