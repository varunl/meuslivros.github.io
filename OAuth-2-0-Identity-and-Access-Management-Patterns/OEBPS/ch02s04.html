This registration is outside of the flow and is done separately. Also this registration is not defined in OAuth 2.0 and can be done in various ways. Most commonly the client developer registers the client on some web form and uses the data retrieved from there in order to do the authentication between the client and the authorization server, but more details on this is provided in the next chapter.</p><div class="section" title="Client types and profiles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec20"/>Client types and profiles</h2></div></div></div><p>When registering <a id="id68" class="indexterm"/>the client, the authorization server has to know which type of client is being registered.
