We assume you have some familiarity with command-line Linux; any modern distribution will suffice.</p><p>Some of the examples in this book need multiple machines to see things working, so you will require access to at least three such hosts. Virtual machines are fine for learning and exploration.</p><p>You will generally need the big data technologies, such as Hadoop and Storm, to run your Hadoop and Storm clusters.</p></div></body></html>
