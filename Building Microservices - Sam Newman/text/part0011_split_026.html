<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="privacy issues" id="idp11690880" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="privacy issues" id="idp11691856" class="calibre3"></a>As disk space becomes cheaper and the capabilities of the databases improve, the ease with which bulk amounts of information can be captured and stored is improving rapidly. This data is valuable — not only to businesses themselves, which increasingly see data as a valuable asset, but equally to the users who value their own privacy. The data that pertains to an individual, or could be used to derive information about an individual, must be the data we are most careful about.</p>

<p class="author">However, what if we made our lives a bit easier? Why not scrub as much information as possible that can be personally identifiable, and do it as soon as possible? When logging a request from a user, do we need to store the entire IP address forever, or could we replace the last few digits with <em class="calibre4">x</em>? Do we need to store someone’s name, age, gender, and date of birth in order to provide her with product offers, or is her age range and postcode enough information?</p>

<p class="author">The advantages here are manifold. First, if you don’t store it, no one can steal it. Second, if you don’t store it, no one (e.g., a governmental agency) can ask for it either!</p>

<p class="author">The German phrase <em class="calibre4">Datensparsamkeit</em> represents this concept. Originating from German privacy legislation, it encapsulates the concept of only storing as much information as is <em class="calibre4">absolutely required</em> to fulfill business operations or satisfy local laws.</p>

<p class="author">This is obviously in direct tension with the move toward storing more and more information, but it is a start to realize that this tension even exists!</p>
