<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="education/awareness of" id="idp11705888" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)" id="idp11706864" class="calibre3"></a>Just as with automated functional testing, we don’t want security to be left to a different set of people, nor do we want to leave everything to the last minute. Helping educate developers about security concerns is key, as raising everyone’s general awareness of security issues can help reduce them in the first place. Getting people familar with the OWASP Top Ten list and OWASP’s Security Testing Framework can be a great place to start. Specialists absolutely have their place, though, and if you have access to them, use them to help you.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)" id="idp11708576" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Brakeman" id="idp11709280" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Security Development Lifecycle" id="idp11709952" class="calibre3"></a>There are automated tools that can probe our systems for vulnerabilities, such as by looking for cross-site scripting attacks. The Zed Attack Proxy (aka ZAP) is a good example. Informed by the work of OWASP, ZAP attempts to re-create malicious attacks on your website. Other tools exist that use static analysis to look for common coding mistakes that can open up security holes, such as <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/" class="calibre3">Brakeman</a> for Ruby. Where these tools can be easily integrated into normal CI builds, integrate them into your standard check-ins. Other sorts of automated tests are more involved. For example, using something like Nessus to scan for vulnerabilities is a bit more involved and it may require a human to interpret the results. That said, these tests are still automatable, and it may make sense to run them with the same sort of cadence as load testing.</p>

<p class="author">Microsoft’s <a href="http://bit.ly/1nYsK6v" class="calibre3">Security Development Lifecycle</a> also has some good models for how delivery teams can bake security in. Some aspects of it feel overly waterfall, but take a look and see what aspects can fit into your current workflow.</p>
