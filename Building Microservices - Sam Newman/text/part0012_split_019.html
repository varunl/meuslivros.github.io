<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Conway's law" data-secondary="in reverse" id="idp11842176" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="system design" data-secondary="effect on organizational structure" id="idp11843152" class="calibre3"></a>So far, we’ve spoken about how the organization impacts the system design. But what about the reverse? Namely, can a system design change the organization? While I haven’t been able to find the same quality of evidence to support the idea that Conway’s law works in reverse, I’ve seen it anecdotally.</p>

<p class="author">Probably the best example was a client I worked with many years ago. Back in the days when the Web was fairly nascent, and the Internet was seen as something that arrived on an AOL floppy disk through the door, this company was a large print firm that had a small, modest website. It had a website because it was the thing to do, but in the grand scheme of things it was fairly unimportant to how the business operated. When the original system was created, a fairly arbitrary technical decision was made as to how the system would work.</p>

<p class="author">The content for this system was sourced in multiple ways, but most of it came from third parties who were placing ads for viewing by the general public. There was an input system that allowed content to be created by the paying third parties, a central system that took that data and enriched it in various ways, and an output system that created the final website that the general public could browse.</p>

<p class="author">Whether the original design decisions were right at the time is a conversation for historians, but many years on the company had changed quite a bit and I and many of my colleagues were starting to wonder if the system design was fit for the company’s present state. Its physical print business had diminished significantly, and the revenues and therefore business operations of the organization were now dominated by its online presence.</p>

<p class="author">What we saw at that time was an organization tightly aligned to this three-part system. Three channels or divisions in the IT side of the business aligned with each of the input, core, and output parts of the business. Within those channels, there were separate delivery teams. What I didn’t realize at the time was that these organizational structures didn’t predate the system design, but actually grew up around it. As the print side of the business diminished, and the digital side of the business grew, the system design inadvertently lay the path for how the organization grew.</p>

<p class="author">In the end we realized that whatever the shortcomings of the system design were, we would have to make changes to the organizational structure to make a shift. Many years later, that process remains a work in progress!</p>
