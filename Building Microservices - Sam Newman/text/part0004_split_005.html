<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="decision-making guidelines" data-secondary="strategic goals" id="idp4096160" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="strategic goals" data-secondary="understanding" id="idp4097152" class="calibre3"></a>The role of the architect is already daunting enough, so luckily we usually don’t have to also define strategic goals! Strategic goals should speak to where your company is going, and how it sees itself as best making its customers happy. These will be high-level goals, and may not include technology at all. They could be defined at a company level or a division level. They might be things like “Expand into Southeast Asia to unlock new markets,” or “Let the customer achieve as much as possible using self-service.” The key is that this is where your organization is headed, so you need to make sure the technology is aligned to it.</p>
