<p class="author">This book is dedicated to Lindy Stephens, without whom it wouldn’t exist. She encouraged me to start on this journey, supported me throughout the often stressful process of writing, and is the best partner I could have ever asked for. I would also like to dedicate this to my dad, Howard Newman, who has always been there for me. This is for both of you.</p>

<p class="author">I would like to single out Ben Christensen, Vivek Subramaniam, and Martin Fowler for providing detailed feedback throughout the writing process, helping shape what this book became. I’d also like to thank James Lewis, with whom I have consumed many beers discussing the ideas presented in this book. This book would be a shadow of itself without their help and guidance.</p>

<p class="author">In addition, many others provided help and feedback on early versions of the book. Specifically, I would like to thank (in no particular order) Kane Venables, Anand Krishnaswamy, Kent McNeil, Charles Haynes, Chris Ford, Aidy Lewis, Will Thames, Jon Eaves, Rolf Russell, Badrinath Janakiraman, Daniel Bryant, Ian Robinson, Jim Webber, Stewart Gleadow, Evan Bottcher, Eric Sword, Olivia Leonard, and all my other colleagues at ThoughtWorks and across the industry who have helped me get this far.</p>

<p class="author">Finally, I would like to thank all the people at O’Reilly, including Mike Loukides for getting me on board, my editor Brian MacDonald, Rachel Monaghan, Kristen Brown, Betsy Waliszewski, and all the other people who have helped in ways I may never know about.</p>
