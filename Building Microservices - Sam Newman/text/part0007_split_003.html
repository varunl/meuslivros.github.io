<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="decompositional techniques" data-secondary="selecting separation points" id="idp10267472" class="calibre3"></a>Deciding that you’d like a monolithic service or application to be smaller is a good start. But I would strongly advise you to chip away at these systems. An incremental approach will help you learn about microservices as you go, and will also limit the impact of getting something wrong (and you will get things wrong!). Think of our monolith as a block of marble. We could blow the whole thing up, but that rarely ends well. It makes much more sense to just chip away at it incrementally.</p>

<p class="author">So if we are going to break apart the monolith a piece at a time, where should we start? We have our seams now, but which one should we pull out first? It’s best to think about where you are going to get the most benefit from some part of your codebase being separated, rather than just splitting things for the sake of it. Let’s consider some drivers that might help guide our chisel.</p>
