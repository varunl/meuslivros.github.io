<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="virtualization approach" id="idp10697088" class="calibre3"></a>One of the key tools available to us in managing a large number of hosts is finding ways of chunking up existing physical machines into smaller parts. Traditional virtualization like VMWare or that used by AWS has yielded huge benefits in reducing the overhead of host management. However, there have been some new advances in this space that are well worth exploring, as they can open up even more interesting possibilities for dealing with our microservice architecture.</p>
