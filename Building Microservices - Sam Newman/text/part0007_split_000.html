<p class="author">We’ve discussed what a good service looks like, and why smaller servers may be better for us. We also previously discussed the importance of being able to evolve the design of our systems. But how do we handle the fact that we may already have a large number of codebases lying about that don’t follow these patterns? How do we go about decomposing these monolithic applications without having to embark on a big-bang rewrite?</p>

<p class="author">The monolith grows over time. It acquires new functionality and lines of code at an alarming rate. Before long it becomes a big, scary giant presence in our organization that people are scared to touch or change. But all is not lost! With the right tools at our disposal, we can slay this beast.</p>
