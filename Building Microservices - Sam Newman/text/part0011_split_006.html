<p class="author">Depending on the sensitivity of the data, this might be fine. Some organizations attempt to ensure security at the perimeter of their networks, and therefore assume they don’t need to do anything else when two services are talking together. However, should an attacker penetrate your network, you will have little protection against a typical <em class="calibre4">man-in-the-middle</em> attack. If the attacker decides to intercept and read the data being sent, change the data without you knowing, or even in some circumstances pretend to be the thing you are talking to, you may not know much about it.</p>

<p class="author">This is by far the most common form of inside-perimeter trust I see in organizations. They may decide to run this traffic over HTTPS, but they don’t do much else. I’m not saying that is a good thing! For most of the organizations I see using this model, I worry that the implicit trust model is not a conscious decision, but more that people are unaware of the risks in the first place.</p>
