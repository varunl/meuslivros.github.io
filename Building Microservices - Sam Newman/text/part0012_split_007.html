<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="system design" data-secondary="service ownership" id="idp11770832" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="service ownership" data-secondary="comprehensive approach" id="idp11771808" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ownership" data-secondary="system design and" id="idp11772752" class="calibre3"></a>What do I mean by <em class="calibre4">service ownership</em>? In general, it means that the team owning a service is responsible for making changes to that service. The team should feel free to restructure the code however it wants, as long as that change doesn’t break consuming services. For many teams, <em class="calibre4">ownership</em> extends to all aspects of the service, from sourcing requirements to building, deploying, and maintaining the application. This model is especially prevalent with microservices, where it is easier for a small team to own a small service. This increased level of ownership leads to increased autonomy and speed of delivery. Having one team responsible for deploying and maintaining the application means it has an incentive to create services that are <em class="calibre4">easy</em> to deploy; that is, concerns about “throwing something over the wall” dissipate when there is no one to throw it to!</p>

<p class="author">This model is certainly one I favor. It pushes the decisions to the people best able to make them, giving the team both increased power and autonomy, but also making it accountable for its work. I’ve seen far too many developers hand their system over for testing or deployment phases and think that their work is done at that point.</p>
