<p class="author">We want to make it easy for consumers to use our service. Having a beautifully factored microservice doesn’t count for much if the cost of using it as a consumer is sky high! So let’s think about what makes it easy for consumers to use our wonderful new service. Ideally, we’d like to allow our clients full freedom in their technology choice, but on the other hand, providing a client library can ease adoption. Often, however, such libraries are incompatible with other things we want to achieve. For example, we might use client libraries to make it easy for consumers, but this can come at the cost of increased coupling.</p>
