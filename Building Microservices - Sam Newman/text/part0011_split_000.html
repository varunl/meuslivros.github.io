<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="importance of" id="idp11491824" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" id="ix_security" class="calibre3"></a>We’ve become familiar with stories about security breaches of large-scale systems resulting in our data being exposed to all sorts of dodgy characters. But more recently, events like the Edward Snowden revelations have made us even more aware of the value of data that companies hold about us, and the value of data that we hold for our customers in the systems we build. This chapter will give a brief overview of some aspects of security you should consider when designing your systems. While not meant to be exhaustive, it will lay out some of the main options available to you and give you a starting point for your own further research.</p>

<p class="author">We need to think about what protection our data needs while in transit from one point to another, and what protection it needs at rest. We need to think about the security of our underlying operating systems, and our networks too. There is so much to think about, and so much we could do! So how much security do we need? How can we work out what is <em class="calibre4">enough</em> security?</p>

<p class="author">But we also need to think of the human element. How do we know who a person is, and what he can do? And how does this relate to how our servers talk to each other? Let’s start there.</p>
