<p class="author">The other point to consider when youâ€™ve identified a couple of seams to separate is how entangled that code is with the rest of the system. We want to pull out the seam that is least depended on if we can. If you can view the various seams you have found as a directed acyclical graph of dependencies (something the package modeling tools I mentioned earlier are very good at), this can help you spot the seams that are likely going to be harder to disentangle.</p>

<p class="author">This brings us to what is often the mother of all tangled dependencies: the database.</p>
