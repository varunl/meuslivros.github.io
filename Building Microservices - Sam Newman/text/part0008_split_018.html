<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="automation" id="idp10683904" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="automation" data-secondary="benefits for deployment" id="idp10684880" class="calibre3"></a>The answer to so many problems we have raised so far comes down to automation. With a small number of machines, it is possible to manage everything manually. I used to do this. I remember running a small set of production machines, and I would collect logs, deploy software, and check processes by manually logging in to the box. My productivity seemed to be constrained by the number of terminal windows I could have open at once — a second monitor was a huge step up. This breaks down really fast, though.</p>

<p class="author">One of the pushbacks against the single-service-per-host setup is the perception that the amount of overhead to manage these hosts will increase. This is certainly true if you are doing everything manually. Double the servers, double the work! But if we automate control of our hosts, and deployment of the services, then there is no reason why adding more hosts should increase our workload in a linear fashion.</p>

<p class="author">But even if we keep the number of hosts small, we still are going to have lots of services. That means multiple deployments to handle, services to monitor, logs to collect. Automation is essential.</p>

<p class="author">Automation is also how we can make sure that our developers still remain productive. Giving them the ability to self-service-provision individual services or groups of services is key to making developers’ lives easier. Ideally, developers should have access to exactly the same tool chain as is used for deployment of our production services so as to ensure that we can spot problems early on. We’ll be looking at a lot of technology in this chapter that embraces this view.</p>

<p class="author">Picking technology that enables automation is highly important. This starts with the tools used to manage hosts. Can you write a line of code to launch a virtual machine, or shut one down? Can you deploy the software you have written automatically? Can you deploy database changes without manual intervention? Embracing a culture of automation is key if you want to keep the complexities of microservice architectures in check.</p>
