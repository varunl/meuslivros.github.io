<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="decision-making guidelines" data-secondary="customized approach to" id="idp4115488" class="calibre3"></a>One person’s principles are another’s practices. You might decide to call the use of HTTP/REST a principle rather than a practice, for example. And that would be fine. The key point is that there is value in having overarching ideas that guide how the system evolves, and in having enough detail so that people know how to implement those ideas. For a small enough group, perhaps a single team, combining principles and practices might be OK. However, for larger organizations, where the technology and working practices may differ, you may want a different set of practices in different places, as long as they both map to a common set of principles. A .NET team, for example, might have one set of practices, and a Java team another, with a set of practices common to both. The principles, though, could be the same for both.</p>
