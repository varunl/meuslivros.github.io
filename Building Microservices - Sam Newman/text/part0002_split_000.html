<p class="author">Microservices are an approach to distributed systems that promote the use of finely grained services with their own lifecycles, which collaborate together. Because microservices are primarily modeled around business domains, they avoid the problems of traditional tiered architectures. Microservices also integrate new technologies and techniques that have emerged over the last decade, which helps them avoid the pitfalls of many service-oriented architecture implementations.</p>

<p class="author">This book is full of concrete examples of microservice use around the world, including in organizations like Netflix, Amazon, Gilt, and the REA group, who have all found that the increased autonomy this architecture gives their teams is a huge advantage.</p>
