<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="testing" data-secondary="considerations for" id="idp11122592" class="calibre3"></a>When you’re reading the pyramid, the key thing to take away is that as you go up the pyramid, the test scope increases, as does our confidence that the functionality being tested works. On the other hand, the feedback cycle time increases as the tests take longer to run, and when a test fails it can be harder to determine which functionality has broken. As you go down the pyramid, in general the tests become much faster, so we get much faster feedback cycles. We find broken functionality faster, our continuous integration builds are faster, and we are less likely to move on to a new task before finding out we have broken something. When those smaller-scoped tests fail, we also tend to know what broke, often exactly what line of code. On the flipside, we don’t get a lot of confidence that our system as a whole works if we’ve only tested one line of code!</p>

<p class="author">When broader-scoped tests like our service or end-to-end tests fail, we will try to write a fast unit test to catch that problem in the future. In that way, we are constantly trying to improve our feedback cycles.</p>

<p class="author">Virtually every team I’ve worked on has used different names than the ones that Cohn uses in the pyramid. Whatever you call them, the key takeaway is that you will want tests of different scope for different purposes.</p>
