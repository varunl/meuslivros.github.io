<p class="author">Obviously, one of the reasons you may find yourself with a single service owned by more than one team is that the cost of splitting the service is too high, or perhaps your organization might not see the point of it. This is a common occurrence with large monolithic systems. If this is the main challenge you face, then I hope some of the advice given in <a data-type="xref" href="part0007_split_000.html#splitting-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 5</a> will be of use. You could also consider merging teams together, to align more closely with the architecture itself.</p>
