<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="database decomposition" data-secondary="transactional boundaries" id="idp10359632" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="transactional boundaries" id="ix_transbound" class="calibre3"></a>Transactions are useful things. They allow us to say <em class="calibre4">these events either all happen together, or none of them happen</em>. They are very useful when we’re inserting data into a database; they let us update multiple tables at once, knowing that if anything fails, everything gets rolled back, ensuring our data doesn’t get into an inconsistent state. Simply put, a transaction allows us to group together multiple different activities that take our system from one consistent state to another — everything works, or nothing changes.</p>

<p class="author">Transactions don’t just apply to databases, although we most often use them in that context. Message brokers, for example, have long allowed you to post and receive messages within transactions too.</p>

<p class="author">With a monolithic schema, all our create or updates will probably be done within a single transactional boundary. When we split apart our databases, we lose the safety afforded to us by having a single transaction. Consider a simple example in the <span class="firstname">MusicCorp</span> context. When creating an order, I want to update the order table stating that a customer order has been created, and also put an entry into a table for the warehouse team so it knows there is an order that needs to be picked for dispatch. We’ve gotten as far as grouping our application code into separate packages, and have also separated the customer and warehouse parts of the schema well enough that we are ready to put them into their own schemas prior to separating the application code.</p>

<p class="author">Within a single transaction in our existing monolithic schema, creating the order and inserting the record for the warehouse team takes place within a single transaction, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="part0007_split_017.html#a58-single-transaction" class="calibre3">Figure 5-10</a>.</p>

<p class="author">But if we have pulled apart the schema into two separate schemas, one for customer-related data including our order table, and another for the warehouse, we have lost this transactional safety. The order placing process now spans two separate transactional boundaries, as we see in <a data-type="xref" href="part0007_split_017.html#a58-separate-txn-boundaries" class="calibre3">Figure 5-11</a>. If our insert into the order table fails, we can clearly stop everything, leaving us in a consistent state. But what happens when the insert into the order table works, but the insert into the picking table fails?</p>
