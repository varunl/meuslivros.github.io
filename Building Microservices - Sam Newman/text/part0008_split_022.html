<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="virtualization platforms" data-secondary="Vagrant" id="idp10718096" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Vagrant" id="idp10719040" class="calibre3"></a>Vagrant is a very useful deployment platform, which is normally used for dev and test rather than production. Vagrant provides you with a virtual cloud on your laptop. Underneath, it uses a standard virtualization system (typically VirtualBox, although it can use other platforms). It allows you to define a set of VMs in a text file, along with how the VMs are networked together and which images the VMs should be based on. This text file can be checked in and shared between team members.</p>

<p class="author">This makes it easier for you to create production-like environments on your local machine. You can spin up multiple VMs at a time, shut individual ones to test failure modes, and have the VMs mapped through to local directories so you can make changes and see them reflected immediately. Even for teams using on-demand cloud platforms like AWS, the faster turnaround of using Vagrant can be a huge boon for development teams.</p>

<p class="author">One of the downsides, though, is that running lots of VMs can tax the average development machine. If we have one service to one VM, you may not be able to bring up your entire system on your local machine. This can result in the need to stub out some dependencies to make things manageable, which is one more thing youâ€™ll have to handle to ensure that the development and test experience is a good one.</p>
