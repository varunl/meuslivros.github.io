<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="system design" data-secondary="internal open source model" id="idp11800400" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="internal open source model" id="idp11801344" class="calibre3"></a>So what if we’ve tried our hardest, but we just can’t find a way past having a few shared services? At this point, properly embracing the internal open source model can make a lot of sense.</p>

<p class="author">With normal open source, a small group of people are considered core committers. They are the custodians of the code. If you want a change to an open source project, you either ask one of the committers to make the change for you, or else you make the change yourself and send them a pull request. The core committers are still in charge of the codebase; they are the owners.</p>

<p class="author">Inside the organization, this pattern can work well too. Perhaps the people who worked on the service originally are no longer on a team together; perhaps they are now scattered across the organization. Well, if they still have commit rights, you can find them and ask for their help, perhaps pairing up with them, or if you have the right tooling you can send them a pull request.</p>
