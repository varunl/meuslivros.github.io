<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices at scale" data-secondary="caching" id="idp12150688" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="caching" data-secondary="benefits of" id="idp12151664" class="calibre3"></a>Caching is a commonly used performance optimization whereby the previous result of some operation is stored, so that subsequent requests can use this stored value rather than spending time and resources recalculating the value. More often than not, caching is about eliminating needless round-trips to databases or other services to serve results faster. Used well, it can yield huge performance benefits. The reason that HTTP scales so well in handling large numbers of requests is that the concept of caching is built in.</p>

<p class="author">Even with a simple monolithic web application, there are quite a few choices as to where and how to cache. With a microservice architecture, where each service is its own source of data and behavior, we have many more choices to make about where and how to cache. With a distributed system, we typically think of caching either on the client side or on the server side. But which is best?</p>
