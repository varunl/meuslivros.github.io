<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="decision-making guidelines" data-secondary="practices for" id="idp4110160" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="design/delivery practices" data-secondary="development of" id="idp4111152" class="calibre3"></a>Our practices are how we ensure our principles are being carried out. They are a set of detailed, practical guidance for performing tasks. They will often be technology-specific, and should be low level enough that any developer can understand them. Practices could include coding guidelines, the fact that all log data needs to be captured centrally, or that HTTP/REST is the standard integration style. Due to their technical nature, practices will often change more often than principles.</p>

<p class="author">As with principles, sometimes practices reflect constraints in your organization. For example, if you support only CentOS, this will need to be reflected in your practices.</p>

<p class="author">Practices should underpin our principles. A principle stating that delivery teams control the full lifecycle of their systems may mean you have a practice stating that all services are deployed into isolated AWS accounts, providing self-service management of the resources and isolation from other teams.</p>
