<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="modeling services" data-secondary="business concepts" id="idp4275600" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="business concepts" id="idp4276576" class="calibre3"></a>The changes we implement to our system are often about changes the business wants to make to how the system behaves. We are changing functionality — capabilities — that are exposed to our customers. If our systems are decomposed along the bounded contexts that represent our domain, the changes we want to make are more likely to be isolated to one, single microservice boundary. This reduces the number of places we need to make a change, and allows us to deploy that change quickly.</p>

<p class="author">It’s also important to think of the communication between these microservices in terms of the same business concepts. The modeling of your software after your business domain shouldn’t stop at the idea of bounded contexts. The same terms and ideas that are shared between parts of your organization should be reflected in your interfaces. It can be useful to think of forms being sent between these microservices, much as forms are sent around an organization.</p>
