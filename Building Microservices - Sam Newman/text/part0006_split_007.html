<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="integration" data-secondary="shared databases" id="idp4365984" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="customers, interfacing with" data-secondary="shared databases" id="idp4366960" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="database integration" id="idp4367920" class="calibre3"></a>By far the most common form of integration that I or any of my colleagues see in the industry is database (DB) integration. In this world, if other services want information from a service, they reach into the database. And if they want to change it, they reach into the database! This is really simple when you first think about it, and is probably the fastest form of integration to start with — which probably explains its popularity.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="xref" href="part0006_split_007.html#a50-db-integration" class="calibre3">Figure 4-1</a> shows our registration UI, which creates customers by performing SQL operations directly on the database. It also shows our call center application that views and edits customer data by running SQL on the database. And the warehouse updates information about customer orders by querying the database. This is a common enough pattern, but it’s one fraught with difficulties.</p>

<p class="author">First, we are allowing external parties to view and bind to internal implementation details. The data structures I store in the DB are fair game to all; they are shared in their entirety with all other parties with access to the database. If I decide to change my schema to better represent my data, or make my system easier to maintain, I can break my consumers. The DB is effectively a very large, shared API that is also quite brittle. If I want to change the logic associated with, say, how the helpdesk manages customers and this requires a change to the database, I have to be extremely careful that I don’t break parts of the schema used by other services. This situation normally results in requiring a large amount of regression testing.</p>

<p class="author">Second, my consumers are tied to a specific technology choice. Perhaps right now it makes sense to store customers in a relational database, so my consumers use an appropriate (potentially DB-specific) driver to talk to it. What if over time we realize we would be better off storing data in a nonrelational database? Can it make that decision? So consumers are intimately tied to the implementation of the customer service. As we discussed earlier, we really want to ensure that implementation detail is hidden from consumers to allow our service a level of autonomy in terms of how it changes its internals over time. Goodbye, loose coupling.</p>

<p class="author">Finally, let’s think about behavior for a moment. There is going to be logic associated with how a customer is changed. Where is that logic? If consumers are directly manipulating the DB, then they have to own the associated logic. The logic to perform the same sorts of manipulation to a customer may now be spread among multiple consumers. If the warehouse, registration UI, and call center UI all need to edit customer information, I need to fix a bug or change the behavior in three different places, and deploy those changes too. Goodbye, cohesion.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sharing behavior" id="idp4376256" class="calibre3"></a>Remember when we talked about the core principles behind good microservices? Strong cohesion and loose coupling — with database integration, we lose both things. Database integration makes it easy for services to share data, but does nothing about <em class="calibre4">sharing behavior</em>. Our internal representation is exposed over the wire to our consumers, and it can be very difficult to avoid making breaking changes, which inevitably leads to a fear of any change at all. Avoid at (nearly) all costs.</p>

<p class="author">For the rest of the chapter, we’ll explore different styles of integration that involve collaborating services, which themselves hide their own internal representations.</p>
