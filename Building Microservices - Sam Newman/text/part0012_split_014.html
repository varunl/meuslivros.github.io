<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="system design" data-secondary="service maturity" id="idp11812256" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="maturity" id="idp11813232" class="calibre3"></a>The less stable or mature a service is, the harder it will be to allow people outside the core team to submit patches. Before the key spine of a service is in place, the team may not know what <em class="calibre4">good</em> looks like, and therefore may struggle to know what a good submission looks like. During this stage, the service itself is undergoing a high degree of change.</p>

<p class="author">Most open source projects tend to not take submissions from a wider group of untrusted committers until the core of the first version is done. Following a similar model for your own organizations makes sense. If a service is pretty mature, and is rarely changed — for example, our cart service — then perhaps that is the time to open it up for other contributions.</p>
