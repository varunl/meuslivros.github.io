Why? Well, if we want to change behavior, we want to be able to change it in one place, and release that change as soon as possible. If we have to change that behavior in lots of different places, we’ll have to release lots of different services (perhaps at the same time) to deliver that change. Making changes in lots of different places is slower, and deploying lots of services at once is risky — both of which we want to avoid.</p>

<p class="author">So we want to find boundaries within our problem domain that help ensure that related behavior is in one place, and that communicate with other boundaries as loosely as possible.</p>
