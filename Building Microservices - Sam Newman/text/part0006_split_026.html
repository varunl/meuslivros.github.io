<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="integration" data-secondary="DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)" id="idp6907152" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)" id="idp6908144" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="code reuse" id="idp6908832" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="shared code" id="idp6909504" class="calibre3"></a>One of the acronyms we developers hear a lot is DRY: don’t repeat yourself. Though its definition is sometimes simplified as trying to avoid duplicating code, DRY more accurately means that we want to avoid duplicating our system <em class="calibre4">behavior and knowledge</em>. This is very sensible advice in general. Having lots of lines of code that do the same thing makes your codebase larger than needed, and therefore harder to reason about. When you want to change behavior, and that behavior is duplicated in many parts of your system, it is easy to forget everywhere you need to make a change, which can lead to bugs. So using DRY as a mantra, in general, makes sense.</p>

<p class="author">DRY is what leads us to create code that can be reused. We pull duplicated code into abstractions that we can then call from multiple places. Perhaps we go as far as making a shared library that we can use everywhere! This approach, however, can be deceptively dangerous in a microservice architecture.</p>

<p class="author">One of the things we want to avoid at all costs is overly coupling a microservice and consumers such that any small change to the microservice itself can cause unnecessary changes to the consumer. Sometimes, however, the use of shared code can create this very coupling. For example, at one client we had a library of common domain objects that represented the core entities in use in our system. This library was used by all the services we had. But when a change was made to one of them, all services had to be updated. Our system communicated via message queues, which also had to be drained of their now <em class="calibre4">invalid</em> contents, and woe betide you if you forgot.</p>

<p class="author">If your use of shared code ever leaks outside your service boundary, you have introduced a potential form of coupling. Using common code like logging libraries is fine, as they are internal concepts that are invisible to the outside world. RealEstate.com.au makes use of a tailored service template to help bootstrap new service creation. Rather than make this code shared, the company copies it for every new service to ensure that coupling doesn’t leak in.</p>

<p class="author">My general rule of thumb: don’t violate DRY within a microservice, but be relaxed about violating DRY across all services. The evils of too much coupling between services are far worse than the problems caused by code duplication. There is one specific use case worth exploring further, though.</p>
