<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="database scaling" data-secondary="for writes" id="idp12055520" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sharding" id="idp12056496" class="calibre3"></a>Reads are comparatively easy to scale. What about writes? One approach is to use <em class="calibre4">sharding</em>. With sharding, you have multiple database nodes. You take a piece of data to be written, apply some hashing function to the key of the data, and based on the result of the function learn where to send the data. To pick a very simplistic (and actually bad) example, imagine that customer records A–M go to one database instance, and N–Z another. You can manage this yourself in your application, but some databases, like Mongo, handle much of it for you.</p>

<p class="author">The complexity with sharding for writes comes from handling queries. Looking up an individual record is easy, as I can just apply the hashing function to find which instance the data should be on, and then retrieve it from the correct shard. But what about queries that span the data in multiple nodes — for example, finding all the customers who are over 18? If you want to query all shards, you either need to query each individual shard and join in memory, or have an alternative read store where both data sets are available. Often querying across shards is handled by an asynchronous mechanism, using cached results. Mongo uses map/reduce jobs, for example, to perform these queries.</p>

<p class="author">One of the questions that emerges with sharded systems is, what happens if I want to add an extra database node? In the past, this would often require significant downtime — especially for large clusters — as you might have to take the entire database down and rebalance the data. More recently, more systems support adding extra shards to a live system, where the rebalancing of data happens in the background; Cassandra, for example, handles this very well. Adding shards to an existing cluster isn’t for the faint of heart, though, so make sure you test this thoroughly.</p>

<p class="author">Sharding for writes may scale for write volume, but may not improve resiliency. If customer records A–M always go to Instance X, and Instance X is unavailable, access to records A–M can be lost. Cassandra offers additional capabilities here, where we can ensure that data is replicated to multiple nodes in a <em class="calibre4">ring</em> (Cassandra’s term for a collection of Cassandra nodes).</p>

<p class="author">As you may have inferred from this brief overview, scaling databases for writes are where things get very tricky, and where the capabilities of the various databases really start to become differentiated. I often see people changing database technology when they start hitting limits on how easily they can scale their existing write volume. If this happens to you, buying a bigger box is often the quickest way to solve the problem, but in the background you might want to look at systems like Cassandra, Mongo, or Riak to see if their alternative scaling models might offer you a better long-term solution.</p>
