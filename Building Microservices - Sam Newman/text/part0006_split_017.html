<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="HATEOS principle" id="idp6163728" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)" data-secondary="HATEOS principle" id="idp6164432" class="calibre3"></a>Another principle introduced in REST that can help us avoid the coupling between client and server is the concept of <em class="calibre4">hypermedia as the engine of application state</em> (often abbreviated as HATEOAS, and boy, did it need an abbreviation). This is fairly dense wording and a fairly interesting concept, so let’s break it down a bit.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="hypermedia" id="idp6166480" class="calibre3"></a>Hypermedia is a concept whereby a piece of content contains links to various other pieces of content in a variety of formats (e.g., text, images, sounds). This should be pretty familiar to you, as it’s what the average web page does: you follow links, which are a form of hypermedia controls, to see related content. The idea behind HATEOAS is that clients should perform interactions (potentially leading to state transitions) with the server via these links to other resources. It doesn’t need to know where exactly customers live on the server by knowing which URI to hit; instead, the client looks for and navigates links to find what it needs.</p>

<p class="author">This is a bit of an odd concept, so let’s first step back and consider how people interact with a web page, which we’ve already established is rich with hypermedia controls.</p>

<p class="author">Think of the Amazon.com shopping site. The location of the shopping cart has changed over time. The graphic has changed. The link has changed. But as humans we are smart enough to still see a shopping cart, know what it is, and interact with it. We have an understanding of what a shopping cart means, even if the exact form and underlying control used to represent it has changed. We know that if we want to view the cart, this is the control we want to interact with. This is why web pages can change incrementally over time. As long as these implicit contracts between the customer and the website are still met, changes don’t need to be breaking changes.</p>

<p class="author">With hypermedia controls, we are trying to achieve the same level of <em class="calibre4">smarts</em> for our electronic consumers. Let’s look at a hypermedia control that we might have for <span class="firstname">MusicCorp</span>. We’ve accessed a resource representing a catalog entry for a given album in <a data-type="xref" href="part0006_split_017.html#a50-album-listing-with-hypermedia" class="calibre3">Example 4-2</a>. Along with information about the album, we see a number of hypermedia controls.</p>
<div id="a50-album-listing-with-hypermedia" data-type="example" class="calibre24">
<h5 class="calibre25"><span class="firstname">Example 4-2. </span>Hypermedia controls used on an album listing</h5>

<p class="author">In this document, we have two hypermedia controls. The client reading such a document needs to know that a control with a relation of <code class="calibre9">artist</code> is where it needs to navigate to get information about the artist, and that <code class="calibre9">instantpurchase</code> is part of the protocol used to purchase the album. The client has to understand the semantics of the API in much the same way as a human being needs to understand that on a shopping website the cart is where the items to be purchased will be.</p>

<p class="author">As a client, I don’t need to know which URI scheme to access to <em class="calibre4">buy</em> the album, I just need to access the resource, find the buy control, and navigate to that. The buy control could change location, the URI could change, or the site could even send me to another service altogether, and as a client I wouldn’t care. This gives us a huge amount of decoupling between the client and server.</p>

<p class="author">We are greatly abstracted from the underlying detail here. We could completely change the implementation of how the control is presented as long as the client can still find a control that matches its understanding of the protocol, in the same way that a shopping cart control might go from being a simple link to a more complex JavaScript control. We are also free to add new controls to the document, perhaps representing new state transitions that we can perform on the resource in question. We would end up breaking our consumers only if we fundamentally changed the semantics of one of the controls so it behaved very differently, or if we removed a control altogether.</p>

<p class="author">Using these controls to decouple the client and server yields significant benefits over time that greatly offset the small increase in the time it takes to get these protocols up and running. By following the links, the client gets to progressively discover the API, which can be a really handy capability when we are implementing new clients.</p>

<p class="author">One of the downsides is that this navigation of controls can be quite chatty, as the client needs to follow links to find the operation it wants to perform. Ultimately, this is a trade-off. I would suggest you start with having your clients navigate these controls first, then optimize later if necessary. Remember that we have a large amount of help out of the box by using HTTP, which we discussed earlier. The evils of premature optimization have been well documented before, so I don’t need to expand upon them here. Also note that a lot of these approaches were developed to create distributed hypertext systems, and not all of them fit! Sometimes you’ll find yourself just wanting good old-fashioned RPC.</p>

<p class="author">Personally, I am a fan of using links to allow consumers to navigate API endpoints. The benefits of progressive discovery of the API and reduced coupling can be significant. However, it is clear that not everyone is sold, as I don’t see it being used anywhere near as much as I would like. I think a large part of this is that there is some initial upfront work required, but the rewards often come later.</p>
