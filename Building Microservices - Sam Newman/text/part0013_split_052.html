<p class="author">As a design approach, microservices are still fairly young, so although we have some notable experiences to draw upon, I’m sure the next few years will yield more useful patterns in handling them at scale. Nonetheless, I hope this chapter has outlined some steps you can take on your journey to microservices at scale that will hold you in good stead.</p>

<p class="author">In addition to what I have covered here, I recommend Michael Nygard’s excellent book <em class="calibre4">Release It!</em>. In it he shares a collection of stories about system failure and some patterns to help deal with it well. The book is well worth a read (in fact, I would go so far as to say it should be considered essential reading for anyone building systems at scale).</p>

<p class="author">We’ve covered quite a lot of ground, and we’re nearing the end. In our next and final chapter, we will look to pull everything back together and summarize what we have learned in the book overall.</p>
