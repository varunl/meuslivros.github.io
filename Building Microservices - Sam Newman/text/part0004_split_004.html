When picking a datastore, do we pick a platform that we have less experience with, but that gives us better scaling? Is it OK for us to have two different technology stacks in our system? What about three? Some decisions can be made completely on the spot with information available to us, and these are the easiest to make. But what about those decisions that might have to be made on incomplete information?</p>

<p class="author">Framing here can help, and a great way to help frame our decision making is to define a set of principles and practices that guide it, based on goals that we are trying to achieve. Letâ€™s look at each in turn.</p>
