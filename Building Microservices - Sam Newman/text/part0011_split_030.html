<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="external verification of" id="idp11715072" class="calibre3"></a>With security, I think there is great value in having an external assessment done. Exercises like penetration testing, when done by an outside party, really do mimic real-world attempts. They also sidestep the issue that teams aren’t always able to see the mistakes they have made themselves, as they are too close to the problem. If you’re a big enough company, you may have a dedicated infosec team that can help you. If not, find an external party who can. Reach out to them early, understand how they like to work, and find out how much notice they need to do a test.</p>

<p class="author">You’ll also need to consider how much verification you require before each release. Generally, doing a full penetration test, for example, isn’t needed for small incremental releases, but may be for larger changes. What you need depends on your own risk profile.</p>
