<h2 class="calibre15" id="calibre_pb_3">Adopt a Culture of Automation</h2>

<p class="author">Microservices add a lot of complexity, a key part of which comes from the sheer number of moving parts we have to deal with. Embracing a culture of automation is one key way to address this, and front-loading effort to create the tooling to support microservices can make a lot of sense. <em class="calibre4">Automated testing</em> is essential, as ensuring our services still work is a more complex process than with monolithic systems. Having a uniform command-line call to <em class="calibre4">deploy the same way everywhere</em> can help, and this can be a key part of adopting <em class="calibre4">continuous delivery</em> to give us fast feedback on the production quality of each check-in.</p>

<p class="author">Consider using <em class="calibre4">environment definitions</em> to help you specify the differences from one environment to another, without sacrificing the ability to use a uniform deployment method. Think about creating <em class="calibre4">custom images</em> to speed up deployment, and embracing the creation of fully automated <em class="calibre4">immutable servers</em> to make it easier to reason about your systems.</p>
