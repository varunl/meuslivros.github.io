<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="tool selection" id="idp11701728" class="calibre3"></a>If there is nothing else you take away from this chapter, let it be this: don’t write your own crypto. Don’t invent your own security protocols. Unless you are a cryptographic expert with years of experience, if you try inventing your own encoding or elaborate cryptographic protections, you will get it wrong. And even <em class="calibre4">if</em> you are a cryptographic expert, you may still get it wrong.</p>

<p class="author">Many of the tools previously outlined, like AES, are industry-hardened technologies whose underlying algorithms have been peer reviewed, and whose software implementation has been rigorously tested and patched over many years. They are good enough! Reinventing the wheel in many cases is often just a waste of time, but when it comes to security it can be outright dangerous.</p>
