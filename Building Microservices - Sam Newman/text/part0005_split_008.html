<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="bounded contexts" data-secondary="premature decomposition" id="idp4246832" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="modeling services" data-secondary="premature decomposition" id="idp4247808" class="calibre3"></a>At ThoughtWorks, we ourselves experienced the challenges of splitting out microservices too quickly. Aside from consulting, we also create a few products. One of them is SnapCI, a hosted continuous integration and continuous delivery tool (we’ll discuss those concepts later in <a data-type="xref" href="part0008_split_000.html#deployment-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 6</a>). The team had previously worked on another similar tool, Go-CD, a now open source continuous delivery tool that can be deployed locally rather than being hosted in the cloud.</p>

<p class="author">Although there was some code reuse very early on between the SnapCI and Go-CD projects, in the end SnapCI turned out to be a completely new codebase. Nonetheless, the previous experience of the team in the domain of CD tooling emboldened them to move more quickly in identifying boundaries, and building their system as a set of microservices.</p>

<p class="author">After a few months, though, it became clear that the use cases of SnapCI were subtly different enough that the initial take on the service boundaries wasn’t quite right. This led to lots of changes being made across services, and an associated high cost of change. Eventually the team merged the services back into one monolithic system, giving them time to better understand where the boundaries should exist. A year later, the team was then able to split the monolithic system apart into microservices, whose boundaries proved to be much more stable. This is far from the only example of this situation I have seen. Prematurely decomposing a system into microservices can be costly, especially if you are new to the domain. In many ways, having an existing codebase you want to decompose into microservices is much easier than trying to go to microservices from the beginning.</p>
