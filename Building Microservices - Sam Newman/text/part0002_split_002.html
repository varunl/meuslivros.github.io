<p class="author">I started thinking about the topic of application architectures many years ago, when working to help people deliver their software faster. I realized that while infrastructure automation, testing, and continuous delivery techniques could help, if the fundamental design of the system doesn’t make it easy to make changes, then there are limits to what can be accomplished.</p>

<p class="author">At the same time, many organizations were experimenting with finer-grained architectures to accomplish similar goals, but also to achieve things like improved scaling, increasing autonomy of teams, or to more easily embrace new technologies. My own experiences, as well as those of my colleagues at ThoughtWorks and elsewhere, reinforced the fact that using larger numbers of services with their own independent lifecycles resulted in more headaches that had to be dealt with. In many ways, this book was imagined as a one-stop shop that would help encompass the wide variety of topics that are necessary for understanding microservices — something that would have helped me greatly in the past!</p>
