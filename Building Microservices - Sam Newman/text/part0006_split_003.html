<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="technology-agnostic APIs" id="idp4351392" class="calibre3"></a>If you have been in the IT industry for more than 15 minutes, you donâ€™t need me to tell you that we work in a space that is changing rapidly. The one certainty <em class="calibre4">is</em> change. New tools, frameworks, and languages are coming out all the time, implementing new ideas that can help us work faster and more effectively. Right now, you might be a .NET shop. But what about in a year from now, or five years from now? What if you want to experiment with an alternative technology stack that might make you more productive?</p>

<p class="author">I am a big fan of keeping my options open, which is why I am such a fan of microservices. It is also why I think it is very important to ensure that you keep the APIs used for communication between microservices technology-agnostic. This means avoiding integration technology that dictates what technology stacks we can use to implement our microservices.</p>
