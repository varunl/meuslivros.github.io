For example, after applying security patches you can often see in logs if people have been exploiting certain vulnerabilities. Patching makes sure it won’t happen again, but if it already <em class="calibre4">has</em> happened, you may need to go into recovery mode. Having logs available allows you to see if something bad happened after the fact.</p>

<p class="author">Note, however, that we need to be careful about what information we store in our logs! Sensitive information needs to be culled to ensure we aren’t leaking important data into our logs, which could end up being a great target for attackers.</p>
