<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="modeling services" data-secondary="business capabilities" id="idp4253680" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="business capabilities" id="idp4254656" class="calibre3"></a>When you start to think about the bounded contexts that exist in your organization, you should be thinking not in terms of data that is shared, but about the capabilities those contexts provide the rest of the domain. The warehouse may provide the capability to get a current stock list, for example, or the finance context may well expose the end-of-month accounts or let you set up payroll for a new recruit. These capabilities may require the interchange of information — shared models — but I have seen too often that thinking about <em class="calibre4">data</em> leads to anemic, CRUD-based (create, read, update, delete) services. So ask first “What does this context do?”, and then “So what data does it need to do that?”</p>

<p class="author">When modeled as services, these capabilities become the key operations that will be exposed over the wire to other collaborators.</p>
