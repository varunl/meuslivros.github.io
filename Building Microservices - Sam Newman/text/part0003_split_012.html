<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="service-oriented architectures (SOA)" data-secondary="concept of" id="idp4078176" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices" data-secondary="vs. service-oriented architecture" id="idp4079216" class="calibre3"></a>Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a design approach where multiple services collaborate to provide some end set of capabilities. A service here typically means a completely separate operating system process. Communication between these services occurs via calls across a network rather than method calls within a process boundary.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="monolithic systems" data-secondary="vs. service-oriented architecture" id="idp4080912" class="calibre3"></a>SOA emerged as an approach to combat the challenges of the large monolithic applications. It is an approach that aims to promote the reusability of software; two or more end-user applications, for example, could both use the same services. It aims to make it easier to maintain or rewrite software, as theoretically we can replace one service with another without anyone knowing, as long as the semantics of the service don’t change too much.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="service-oriented architectures (SOA)" data-secondary="drawbacks of" id="idp4082752" class="calibre3"></a>SOA at its heart is a very sensible idea. However, despite many efforts, there is a lack of good consensus on how to do SOA <em class="calibre4">well</em>. In my opinion, much of the industry has failed to look holistically enough at the problem and present a compelling alternative to the narrative set out by various vendors in this space.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="communication" data-secondary="protocols for (SOAP)" id="idp4084896" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="granularity" id="idp4085872" class="calibre3"></a>Many of the problems laid at the door of SOA are actually problems with things like communication protocols (e.g., SOAP), vendor middleware, a lack of guidance about service granularity, or the wrong guidance on picking places to split your system. We’ll tackle each of these in turn throughout the rest of the book. A cynic might suggest that vendors co-opted (and in some cases drove) the SOA movement as a way to sell more products, and those selfsame products in the end undermined the goal of SOA.</p>

<p class="author">Much of the conventional wisdom around SOA doesn’t help you understand how to split something big into something small. It doesn’t talk about how big is too big. It doesn’t talk enough about real-world, practical ways to ensure that services do not become overly coupled. The number of things that go unsaid is where many of the pitfalls associated with SOA originate.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="service-oriented architectures (SOA)" data-secondary="vs. microservices" id="idp4088256" class="calibre3"></a>The microservice approach has emerged from real-world use, taking our better understanding of systems and architecture to do SOA well. So you should instead think of microservices as a specific approach for SOA in the same way that XP or Scrum are specific approaches for Agile software development.</p>
