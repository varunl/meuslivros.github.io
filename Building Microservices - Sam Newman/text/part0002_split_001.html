<p class="author">The scope of this book is broad, as the implications of fine-grained microservice architectures are also broad. As such, it should appeal to people interested in aspects of design, development, deployment, testing, and maintenance of systems. Those of you who have already embarked on the journey toward finer-grained architectures, whether for a greenfield application or as part of decomposing an existing, more monolithic system, will find plenty of practical advice to help you. It will also help those of you who want to know what all the fuss is about, so that you can determine whether microservices are right for you.</p>
