<p class="author">Books about ideas work better with examples. Where possible, I’ll be sharing stories from real-world situations, but I’ve found it’s also useful to have a fictional domain with which to work. Throughout the book, we’ll be returning to this domain, seeing how the concept of microservices works within this world.</p>

<p class="author">So let’s turn our attention to the cutting-edge online retailer MusicCorp. MusicCorp was recently a brick-and-mortar retailer, but after the bottom dropped out of the gramophone record business it focused more and more of its efforts online. The company has a website, but feels that now is the time to double-down on the online world. After all, those iPods are just a passing fad (Zunes are way better, obviously) and music fans are quite happy to wait for CDs to arrive at their doorsteps. Quality over convenience, right? And while we’re at it, what’s this Spotify thing people keep talking about — some sort of skin treatment for teenagers?</p>

<p class="author">Despite being a little behind the curve, MusicCorp has grand ambitions. Luckily, it has decided that its best chance of taking over the world is by making sure it can make changes as easily as possible. Microservices for the win!</p>
