Often, we need to make a choice to cut a few corners to get some urgent features out. This is just one more trade-off that we’ll find ourselves having to make. Our technical vision exists for a reason. If we deviate from this reason, it might have a short-term benefit but a long-term cost. A concept that helps us understand this trade-off is technical debt. When we accrue technical debt, just like debt in the real world it has an ongoing cost, and is something we want to pay down.</p>

<p class="author">Sometimes technical debt isn’t just something we cause by taking shortcuts. What happens if our vision for the system changes, but not all of our system matches? In this situation, too, we have created new sources of technical debt.</p>

<p class="author">The architect’s job is to look at the bigger picture, and understand this balance. Having some view as to the level of debt, and where to get involved, is important. Depending on your organization, you might be able to provide gentle guidance, but have the teams themselves decide how to track and pay down the debt. For other organizations, you may need to be more structured, perhaps maintaining a debt log that is reviewed regularly.</p>
