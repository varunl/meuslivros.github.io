How long can I wait before I can consider a downstream system to actually be down?</p>

<p class="author">Wait too long to decide that a call has failed, and you can slow the whole system down. Time out too quickly, and youâ€™ll consider a call that might have worked as failed. Have no timeouts at all, and a downstream system being down could hang your whole system.</p>

<p class="author">Put timeouts on all out-of-process calls, and pick a default timeout for everything. Log when timeouts occur, look at what happens, and change them accordingly.</p>
