<p class="author">Microservices is a fast-moving topic. Although the idea is not new (even if the term itself is), experiences from people all over the world, along with the emergence of new technologies, are having a profound effect on how they are used. Due to the fast pace of change, I have tried to focus this book on ideas more than specific technologies, knowing that implementation details always change faster than the thoughts behind them. Nonetheless, I fully expect that in a few years from now weâ€™ll have learned even more about where microservices fit, and how to use them well.</p>

<p class="author">So while I have done my best to distill out the essence of the topic in this book, if this topic interests you, be prepared for many years of continuous learning to keep on top of the state of the art!</p>
