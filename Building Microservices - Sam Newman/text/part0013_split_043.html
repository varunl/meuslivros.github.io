<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dynamic service registries" data-secondary="Zookeeper" id="idp12305088" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Zookeeper" id="idp12306080" class="calibre3"></a><a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/" class="calibre3">Zookeeper</a> was originally developed as part of the Hadoop project. It is used for an almost bewildering array of use cases, including configuration management, synchronizing data between services, leader election, message queues, and (usefully for us) as a naming service.</p>

<p class="author">Like many similar types of systems, Zookeeper relies on running a number of nodes in a cluster to provide various guarantees. This means you should expect to be running at least three Zookeeper nodes. Most of the smarts in Zookeeper are around ensuring that data is replicated safely between these nodes, and that things remain consistent when nodes fail.</p>

<p class="author">At its heart, Zookeeper provides a hierarchical namespace for storing information. Clients can insert new nodes in this hierarchy, change them, or query them. Furthermore, they can add watches to nodes to be told when they change. This means we could store the information about where our services are located in this structure, and as a client be told when they change. Zookeeper is often used as a general configuration store, so you could also store service-specific configuration in it, allowing you to do tasks like dynamically changing log levels or turning off features of a running system. Personally, I tend to shy away from the use of systems like Zookeeper as a configuration source, as I think it can make it harder to reason about the behavior of a given service.</p>

<p class="author">Zookeeper itself is fairly generic in what it offers, which is why it is used for so many use cases. You can think of it just as a replicated tree of information that you can be alerted about when it changes. This means that you’ll typically build things on top of it to suit your particular use case. Luckily, client libraries exist for most languages out there.</p>

<p class="author">In the grand scheme of things, Zookeeper could be considered <em class="calibre4">old</em> by now, and doesn’t provide us that much functionality out of the box to help with service discovery compared to some of the newer alternatives. That said, it is certainly tried and tested, and widely used. The underlying algorithms Zookeeper implements are quite hard to get right. I know one database vendor, for example, that was using Zookeeper just for leader election in order to ensure that a primary node got properly promoted during failure conditions. The client felt that Zookeeper was too heavyweight and spent a long time ironing out bugs in its own implementation of the PAXOS algorithm to replace what Zookeeper did. People often say you shouldn’t write your own cryptography libraries. I’d extend that by saying you shouldn’t write your own distributed coordination systems either. There is a lot to be said for using existing stuff that just works.</p>
