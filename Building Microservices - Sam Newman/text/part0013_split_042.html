<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dynamic service registries" data-secondary="benefits of" id="idp12301024" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices at scale" data-secondary="dynamic service registries" id="idp12302016" class="calibre3"></a>The downsides of DNS as a way of finding nodes in a highly dynamic environment have led to a number of alternative systems, most of which involve the service registering itself with some central registry, which in turn offers the ability to look up these services later on. Often, these systems do more than just providing service registration and discovery, which may or may not be a good thing.
