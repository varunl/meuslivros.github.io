<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="service-to-host mapping" data-secondary="terminology" id="idp10632848" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="service-to-host mapping" id="ix_stohmap" class="calibre3"></a>One of the questions that comes up quite early on in the discussion around microservices is “How many services per machine?” Before we go on, we should pick a better term than <em class="calibre4">machine</em>, or even the more generic <em class="calibre4">box</em> that I used earlier. In this era of virtualization, the mapping between a single host running an operating system and the underlying physical infrastructure can vary to a great extent. Thus, I tend to talk  about <em class="calibre4">hosts</em>, using them as a generic unit of isolation — namely, an operating system onto which I can install and run my services. If you are deploying directly on to physical machines, then one physical server maps to one <em class="calibre4">host</em> (which is perhaps not completely correct terminology in this context, but in the absence of better terms may have to suffice). If you’re using virtualization, a single physical machine can map to multiple independent hosts, each of which could hold one or more services.</p>

<p class="author">So when thinking of different deployment models, we’ll talk about hosts. So, then, how many services per host should we have?</p>

<p class="author">I have a definite view as to which model is preferable, but there are a number of factors to consider when working out which model will be right for you. It’s also important to understand that some choices we make in this regard will limit some of the deployment options available to us.</p>
