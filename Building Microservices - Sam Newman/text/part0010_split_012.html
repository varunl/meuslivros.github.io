<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="monitoring" data-secondary="displaying/sharing results" id="idp11452096" class="calibre3"></a>All this data we are gathering is for a purpose. More specifically, we are gathering all this data for different people to help them do their jobs; this data becomes a call to action. Some of this data needs to trigger an immediate call to action for our support team — for example, in the case of one of our synthetic monitoring tests failing. Other data, like the fact that our CPU load has increased by 2% over the last week, is potentially only of interest when we’re doing capacity planning. Likewise, your boss is probably going to want to know right away that revenue dipped 25% after the last release, but probably doesn’t need to be woken up because searches for “Justin Bieber” have gone up 5% in the last hour.</p>

<p class="author">What our people want to see and react to <em class="calibre4">right now</em> is different than what they need when drilling down. So, for the type of person who will be looking at this data, consider the following:</p>

<ul class="stafflist">
<li class="calibre5">
What they need to know right now
</li>
<li class="calibre5">
What they might want later
</li>
<li class="calibre5">
How they like to consume data
</li>
</ul>

<p class="author">Alert on the things they need to know right now. Create big visible displays with this information that sit in the corner of the room. Give them easy access to the data they need to know later. And spend time with them to know how they want to consume data. A discussion about all the nuances involved in the graphical display of quantitative information is certainly outside the scope of this book, but a great place to start is Stephen Few’s excellent book <em class="calibre4">Information Dashboard Design: Displaying Data for At-a-Glance Monitoring</em> (Analytics Press).</p>
