<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="human element of" id="idp11698464" class="calibre3"></a>Much of what we have covered here is the basics of how to implement technological safeguards to protect your systems and data from malicious, external attackers. However, you may also need processes and policies in place to deal with the human element in your organization. How do you revoke access to credentials when someone leaves the organization? How can you protect yourself against social engineering? As a good mental exercise, consider what damage a disgruntled ex-employee could do to your systems if she wanted to. Putting yourself in the mindset of a malicious party is often a good way to reason about the protections you may need, and few malicious parties have as much inside information as a recent employee!</p>
