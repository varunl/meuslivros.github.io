<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="systems architects" data-secondary="team building by" id="idp4166656" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="team building" id="idp4167632" class="calibre3"></a>Being the main point person responsible for the technical vision of your system and ensuring that you’re executing on this vision isn’t just about making technology decisions. It’s the people you work with who will be doing the work. Much of the role of the technical leader is about helping grow them — to help them understand the vision themselves — and also ensuring that they can be active participants in shaping and implementing the vision too.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices" data-secondary="autonomy and" id="idp4169168" class="calibre3"></a>Helping the people around you on their own career growth can take many forms, most of which are outside the scope of this book. There is one aspect, though, where a microservice architecture is especially relevant. With larger, monolithic systems, there are fewer opportunities for people to step up and <em class="calibre4">own</em> something. With microservices, on the other hand, we have multiple autonomous codebases that will have their own independent lifecycles. Helping people step up by having them take ownership of individual services before accepting more responsibility can be a great way to help them achieve their own career goals, and at the same time lightens the load on whoever is in charge!</p>

<p class="author">I am a strong believer that great software comes from great people. If you worry only about the technology side of the equation, you’re missing way more than half of the picture.</p>
