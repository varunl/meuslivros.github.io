<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="service-to-service authentication/authorization" data-secondary="HMAC over HTTP" id="idp11573056" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="hash-based messaging code (HMAC)" id="idp11574064" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="HMAC (hash-based messaging code)" id="idp11574752" class="calibre3"></a>As we discussed earlier, the use of Basic Authentication over plain HTTP is not terribly sensible if we are worried about the username and password being compromised. The traditional alternative is route traffic HTTPS, but there are some downsides. Aside from managing the certificates, the overhead of HTTPS traffic can place additional strain on servers (although, to be honest, this has a lower impact than it did several years ago), and the traffic cannot easily be cached.</p>

<p class="author">An alternative approach, as used extensively by Amazon’s S3 APIs for AWS and in parts of the OAuth specification, is to use a <em class="calibre4">hash-based messaging code (HMAC)</em> to sign the request.</p>

<p class="author">With HMAC the body request along with a private key is hashed, and the resulting hash is sent along with the request. The server then uses its own copy of the private key and the request body to re-create the hash. If it matches, it allows the request. The nice thing here is that if a man in the middle messes with the request, then the hash won’t match and the server knows the request has been tampered with. And the private key is never sent in the request, so it cannot be compromised in transit! The added benefit is that this traffic can then more easily be cached, and the overhead of generating the hashes may well be lower than handling HTTPS traffic (although your mileage may vary).</p>

<p class="author">There are three downsides to this approach. First, both the client and server need a shared secret that needs to be communicated somehow. How do they share it? It could be hardcoded at both ends, but then you have the problem of revoking access if the secret becomes compromised. If you communicate this key over some alternative protocol, then you need to make sure that that protocol is also very secure!</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="JSON web tokens (JWT)" id="idp11579264" class="calibre3"></a>Second, this is a pattern, not a standard, and thus there are divergent ways of implementing it. As a result, there is a dearth of good, open, and usable implementations of this approach. In general, if this approach interests you, then do some more reading to understand the different ways it is done. I’d go as far as to say just look at how Amazon does this for S3 and copy its approach, especially using a sensible hashing function with a suitably long key like SHA-256. <a href="http://bit.ly/T7BMED" class="calibre3">JSON web tokens (JWT)</a> are also worth looking at, as they implement a very similar approach and seem to be gaining traction. But be aware of the difficulty of getting this stuff right. My colleague was working with a team that was implementing its own JWT implementation, omitted a single Boolean check, and invalidated its entire authentication code! Hopefully over time we’ll see more reusable library implementations.</p>

<p class="author">Finally, understand that this approach ensures only that no third party has manipulated the request and that the private key itself remains private. The rest of the data in the request will still be visible to parties snooping on the network.</p>
