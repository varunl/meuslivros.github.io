<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices" data-secondary="replaceability and" id="idp4072912" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="replaceability" id="idp4073888" class="calibre3"></a>If you work at a medium-size or bigger organization, chances are you are aware of some big, nasty legacy system sitting in the corner. The one no one wants to touch. The one that is vital to how your company runs, but that happens to be written in some odd Fortran variant and runs only on hardware that reached end of life 25 years ago. Why hasn’t it been replaced? You know why: it’s too big and risky a job.</p>

<p class="author">With our individual services being small in size, the cost to replace them with a better implementation, or even delete them altogether, is much easier to manage. How often have you deleted more than a hundred lines of code in a single day and not worried too much about it? With microservices often being of similar size, the barriers to rewriting or removing services entirely are very low.</p>

<p class="author">Teams using microservice approaches are comfortable with completely rewriting services when required, and just killing a service when it is no longer needed. When a codebase is just a few hundred lines long, it is difficult for people to become emotionally attached to it, and the cost of replacing it is pretty small.</p>
