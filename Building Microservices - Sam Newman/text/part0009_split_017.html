<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="end-to-end tests" data-secondary="metaversion" id="idp11217968" class="calibre3"></a>With the end-to-end test step, it is easy to start thinking, <em class="calibre4">So, I know all these services at these versions work together, so why not deploy them all together?</em> This very quickly becomes a conversation along the lines of, <em class="calibre4">So why not use a version number for the whole system</em>? To quote <a href="http://bit.ly/15BPCVE" class="calibre3">Brandon Bryars</a>, “Now you have 2.1.0 problems.”</p>

<p class="author">By versioning together changes made to multiple services, we effectively embrace the idea that changing and deploying multiple services at once is acceptable. It becomes the norm, it becomes OK. In doing so, we cede one of the main advantages of microservices: the ability to deploy one service by itself, independently of other services.</p>

<p class="author">All too often, the approach of accepting multiple services being deployed together drifts into a situation where services become coupled. Before long, nicely separate services become increasingly tangled with others, and you never notice as you never try to deploy them by themselves. You end up with a tangled mess where you have to orchestrate the deployment of multiple services at once, and as we discussed previously, this sort of coupling can leave us in a worse place than we would be with a single, monolithic application.</p>

<p class="author">This is bad.</p>
