<h2 class="calibre15" id="calibre_pb_21">It’s About Conversations</h2>

<p class="author">In agile, stories are often referred to as a placeholder for a conversation. CDCs are just like that. They become the codification of a set of discussions about what a service API should look like, and when they break, they become a trigger point to have conversations about how that API should evolve.</p>

<p class="author">It is important to understand that CDCs require good communication and trust between the consumer and producing service. If both parties are in the same team (or the same person!), then this shouldn’t be hard. However, if you are consuming a service provided with a third party, you may not have the frequency of communication, or trust, to make CDCs work. In these situations, you may have to make do with limited larger-scoped integration tests just around the <em class="calibre4">untrusted</em> component. Alternatively, if you are creating an API for thousands of potential consumers, such as with a publicly available web service API, you may have to play the role of the consumer yourself (or perhaps work with a subset of your consumers) in defining these tests. Breaking huge numbers of external consumers is a pretty bad idea, so if anything the importance of CDCs is increased!<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_CDC" id="idp11259728" class="calibre3"></a></p>
