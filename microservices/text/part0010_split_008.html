<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="monitoring" data-secondary="semantic" id="idp11415648" class="calibre3"></a>Now in the past, implementing semantic monitoring was a fairly daunting task. But the world has moved on, and the means to do this is at our fingertips! You are running tests for your systems, right? If not, go read <a data-type="xref" href="part0009_split_000.html#testing-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 7</a> and come back. All done? Good!</p>

<p class="author">If we look at the tests we have that test a given service end to end, or even our whole system end to end, we have much of what we need to implement semantic monitoring. Our system already exposes the hooks needed to launch the test and check the result. So why not just run a subset of these tests, on an ongoing basis, as a way of monitoring our system?</p>

<p class="author">There are some things we need to do, of course. First, we need to be careful about the data requirements of our tests. We may need to find a way for our tests to adapt to different live data if this changes over time, or else set a different source of data. For example, we could have a set of fake users we use in production with a known set of data.</p>

<p class="author">Likewise, we have to make sure we don’t accidentally trigger unforeseen side effects. A friend told me a story about an ecommerce company that accidentally ran its tests against its production ordering systems. It didn’t realize its mistake until a large number of washing machines arrived at the head office.</p>
