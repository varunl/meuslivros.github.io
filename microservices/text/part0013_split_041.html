<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="DNS service" id="idp12286128" class="calibre3"></a>It’s nice to start simple. DNS lets us associate a name with the IP address of one or more machines. We could decide, for example, that our accounts service is always found at <em class="calibre4">accounts.musiccorp.com</em>. We would then have that entry point to the IP address of the host running that service, or perhaps have it resolve to a load balancer that is distributing load across a number of instances. This means we’d have to handle updating these entries as part of deploying our service.</p>

<p class="author">When dealing with instances of a service in different environments, I have seen a convention-based domain template work well. For example, we might have a template defined as <em class="calibre4">&lt;servicename&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;.musiccorp.com</em>, giving us entries like <em class="calibre4">accounts-uat.musiccorp.com</em> or <em class="calibre4">accounts-dev.musiccorp.com</em>.</p>

<p class="author">A more advanced way of handling different environments is to have different domain name servers for different environments. So I could assume that <em class="calibre4">accounts.musiccorp.com</em> is where I always find the accounts service, but it could resolve to different hosts depending on where I do the lookup. If you already have your environments sitting in different network segments and are comfortable with managing your own DNS servers and entries, this could be quite a neat solution, but it is a lot of work if you aren’t getting other benefits from this setup.</p>

<p class="author">DNS has a host of advantages, the main one being it is such a well-understood and well-used standard that almost any technology stack will support it. Unfortunately, while a number of services exist for managing DNS inside an organization, few of them seem designed for an environment where we are dealing with highly disposable hosts, making updating DNS entries somewhat painful. Amazon’s Route53 service does a pretty good job of this, but I haven’t seen a self-hosted option that is as good yet, although (as we’ll discuss shortly) Consul may help us here. Aside from the problems in updating DNS entries, the DNS specification itself can cause us some issues.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="time to live (TTL)" id="idp12292560" class="calibre3"></a>DNS entries for domain names have a <em class="calibre4">time to live</em> (TTL). This is how long a client can consider the entry fresh. When we want to change the host to which the domain name refers, we update that entry, but we have to assume that clients will be holding on to the old IP for <em class="calibre4">at least</em> as long as the TTL states. DNS entries can get cached in multiple places (even the JVM will cache DNS entries unless you tell it not to), and the more places they are cached in, the more stale the entry can be.</p>

<p class="author">One way to work around this problem is to have the domain name entry for your service point to a load balancer, which in turn points to the instances of your service, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="part0013_split_041.html#a115-dns-load-balancer" class="calibre3">Figure 11-9</a>. When you deploy a new instance, you can take the old one out of the load-balancer entry and add the new one. Some people use DNS round-robining, where the DNS entries themselves refer to a group of machines. This technique is extremely problematic, as the client is hidden from the underlying host, and therefore cannot easily stop routing traffic to one of the hosts should it become sick.</p>

<p class="author">As mentioned, DNS is well understood and widely supported. But it does have one or two downsides. I would suggest investigating whether it is a good fit for you before picking something more complex. For a situation where you have only single nodes, having DNS refer directly to hosts is probably fine. But for those situations where you need more than one instance of a host, have DNS entries resolve to load balancers that can handle putting individual hosts into and out of service as appropriate.</p>
