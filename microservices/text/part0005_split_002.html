<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="modeling services" data-secondary="key concepts" id="idp4202032" class="calibre3"></a>Before the team from MusicCorp tears off into the distance, creating service after service in an attempt to deliver eight-track tapes to all and sundry, let’s put the brakes on and talk a bit about the most important underlying idea we need to keep in mind. What makes a good service? If you’ve survived a failed SOA implementation, you may have some idea where I’m going next. But just in case you aren’t that (un)fortunate, I want you to focus on  two key concepts: <em class="calibre4">loose coupling</em> and <em class="calibre4">high cohesion</em>. We’ll talk in detail throughout the book about other ideas and practices, but they are all for naught if we get these two thing wrong.</p>

<p class="author">Despite the fact that these two terms are used a lot, especially in the context of object-oriented systems, it is worth discussing what they mean in terms of microservices.</p>
