<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="automation" data-secondary="case studies on" id="idp10691056" class="calibre3"></a>It is probably helpful to give you a couple of concrete examples that explain the power of good automation. One of our clients in Australia is RealEstate.com.au (REA). Among other things, the company provides real estate listings for retail and commercial customers in Australia and elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region. Over a number of years, it has been moving its platform toward a distributed, microservices design. When it started on this journey it had to spend a lot of time getting the tooling around the services just right — making it easy for developers to provision machines, to deploy their code, or monitor them. This caused a front-loading of work to get things started.</p>

<p class="author">In the first three months of this exercise, REA was able to move just two new microservices into production, with the development team taking full responsibility for the entire build, deployment, and support of the services. In the next three months, between 10–15 services went live in a similar manner. By the end of the 18-month period, REA had over 60–70 services.</p>

<p class="author">This sort of pattern is also borne out by the experiences of <a href="http://bit.ly/1z1WR3T" class="calibre3">Gilt</a>, an online fashion retailer that started in 2007. Gilt’s monolithic Rails application was starting to become difficult to scale, and the company decided in 2009 to start decomposing the system into microservices. Again automation, especially tooling to help developers, was given as a key reason to drive Gilt’s explosion in the use of microservices. A year later, Gilt had around 10 microservices live; by 2012, over 100; and in 2014, over 450 microservices by Gilt’s own count — in other words, around three services for every developer in Gilt.</p>
