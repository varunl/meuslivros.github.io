<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="decision-making guidelines" data-secondary="principles for" id="idp4101424" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="architectural principles" data-secondary="development of" id="idp4102416" class="calibre3"></a>Principles are rules you have made in order to align what you are doing to some larger goal, and will sometimes change. For example, if one of your strategic goals as an organization is to decrease the time to market for new features, you may define a principle that says that delivery teams have full control over the lifecycle of their software to ship whenever they are ready, independently of any other team. If another goal is that your organization is moving to aggressively grow its offering in other countries, you may decide to implement a principle that the entire system must be portable to allow for it to be deployed locally in order to respect sovereignty of data.</p>

<p class="author">You probably don’t want loads of these. Fewer than 10 is a good number — small enough that people can remember them, or to fit on small posters. The more principles you have, the greater the chance that they overlap or contradict each other.</p>

They also may well make sense in other contexts. Some of the principles are actually constraints based on behaviors your application needs to exhibit in order to work on Heroku. A constraint is really something that is very hard (or virtually impossible) to change, whereas principles are things we decide to choose. You may decide to explicitly call out those things that are principles versus those that are constraints, to help indicate those things you really can’t change. Personally, I think there can be some value in keeping them in the same list to encourage challenging constraints every now and then and see if they really are immovable!</p>
