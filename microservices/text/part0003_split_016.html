<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices" data-secondary="drawbacks of" id="idp3808768" class="calibre3"></a>Before we finish, I should call out that microservices are no free lunch or silver bullet, and make for a bad choice as a golden hammer. They have all the associated complexities of distributed systems, and while we have learned a lot about how to manage distributed systems well (which we’ll discuss throughout the book) it is still hard. If you’re coming from a monolithic system point of view, you’ll have to get much better at handling deployment, testing, and monitoring to unlock the benefits we’ve covered so far. You’ll also need to think differently about how you scale your systems and ensure that they are resilient. Don’t also be surprised if things like distributed transactions or CAP theorem start giving you headaches, either!</p>

<p class="author">Every company, organization, and system is different. A number of factors will play into whether or not microservices are right for you, and how aggressive you can be in adopting them. Throughout each chapter in this book I’ll attempt to give you guidance highlighting the potential pitfalls, which should help you chart a steady path.</p>
