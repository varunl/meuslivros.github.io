<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="integration" data-secondary="third-party software" id="idp10178048" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="third-party software" id="ix_thpsoft" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="third-party software" data-secondary="building vs. buying" id="idp10179872" class="calibre3"></a>We’ve looked at approaches to breaking apart existing systems that are under our control, but what about when we can’t change the things we talk to? For many valid reasons, the organizations we work for buy commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) or make use of software as a service (SaaS) offerings over which we have little control. So how do we integrate with them sensibly?</p>

<p class="author">If you’re reading this book, you probably work at an organization that writes code. You might write software for your own internal purposes or for an external client, or both. Nonetheless, even if you are an organization with the ability to create a significant amount of custom software, you’ll still use software products provided by external parties, be they commercial or open source. Why is this?</p>

<p class="author">First, your organization almost certainly has a greater demand for software than can be satisfied internally. Think of all the products you use, from office productivity tools like Excel to operating systems to payroll systems. Creating all of those for your own use would be a mammoth undertaking. Second, and most important, it wouldn’t be cost effective! The cost for you to build your own email system, for example, is likely to dwarf the cost of using an existing combination of mail server and client, even if you go for commercial options.</p>

<p class="author">My clients often struggle with the question “Should I build, or should I buy?” In general, the advice I and my colleagues give when having this conversation with the average enterprise organization boils down to “Build if it is unique to what you do, and can be considered a strategic asset; buy if your use of the tool isn’t that special.”</p>

<p class="author">For example, the average organization would not consider its payroll system to be a strategic asset. People on the whole get paid the same the world over. Likewise, most organizations tend to buy content management systems (CMSes) off the shelf, as their use of such a tool isn’t considered something that is key to their business. On the other hand, I was involved early on in rebuilding the <em class="calibre4">Guardian’s</em> website, and there the decision was made to build a bespoke content management system, as it was core to the newspaper’s business.</p>

<p class="author">So the notion that we will occasionally encounter commercial, third-party software is sensible, and to be welcomed. However, many of us end up cursing some of these systems. Why is that?</p>
