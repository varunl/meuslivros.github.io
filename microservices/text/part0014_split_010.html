<p class="author">Microservice architectures give you more options, and more decisions to make. Making decisions in this world is a far more common activity than in simpler, monolithic systems. You won’t get all of these decisions right, I can guarantee that. So, knowing we are going to get some things wrong, what are our options? Well, I would suggest finding ways to make each decision small in scope; that way, if you get it wrong, you only impact a small part of your system. Learn to embrace the concept of evolutionary architecture, where your system bends and flexes and changes over time as you learn new things. Think not of big-bang rewrites, but instead of a series of changes made to your system over time to keep it supple.</p>

<p class="author">Hopefully by now I’ve shared with you enough information and experiences to help you decide if microservices are for you. If they are, I hope you think of this as a journey, not a destination. Go incrementally. Break your system apart piece by piece, learning as you go. And get used to it: in many ways, the discipline to continually change and evolve our systems is a far more important lesson to learn than any other I have shared with you through this book. Change is inevitable. Embrace it.</p>
