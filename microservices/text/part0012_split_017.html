<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="system design" data-secondary="orphaned services" id="idp11825152" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="orphaned services" id="idp11826128" class="calibre3"></a>So what about services that are no longer being actively maintained? As we move toward finer-grained architectures, the services themselves become smaller. One of the goals of smaller services, as we have discussed, is the fact that they are simpler. Simpler services with less functionality may not need to change for a while. Consider the humble cart service, which provides some fairly modest capabilities: Add to Cart, Remove from Cart, and so on. It is quite conceivable that this service may not have to change for months after first being written, even if active development is still going on. What happens here? Who owns this service?</p>

<p class="author">If your team structures are aligned along the bounded contexts of your organization, then even services that are not changed frequently still have a de facto owner. Imagine a team that is aligned with the consumer web sales context. It might handle the website, cart, and recommendation services. Even if the cart service hasn’t been changed in months, it would naturally fall to this team to make the change. One of the benefits of microservices, of course, is that if the team needs to change the service to add a new feature and not find it to its liking, rewriting it shouldn’t take too long at all.</p>

<p class="author">That said, if you’ve adopted a truly polyglot approach, making use of multiple technology stacks, then the challenges of making changes to an orphaned service could be compounded if your team doesn’t know the tech stack any longer.</p>
