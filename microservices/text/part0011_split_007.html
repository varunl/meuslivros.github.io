<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="service-to-service authentication/authorization" data-secondary="HTTP(S) basic" id="idp11549968" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="HTTP(S) Basic Authentication" id="idp11550976" class="calibre3"></a>HTTP Basic Authentication allows for a client to send a username and password in a standard HTTP header. The server can then check these details and confirm that the client is allowed to access the service. The advantage here is that this is an extremely well-understood and well-supported protocol. The problem is that doing this over HTTP is highly problematic, as the username and password are not sent in a secure manner. Any intermediate party can look at the information in the header and see the data. Thus, HTTP Basic Authentication should normally be used over HTTPS.</p>

<p class="author">When using HTTPS, the client gains strong guarantees that the server it is talking to is who the client thinks it is. It also gives us additional protection against people eavesdropping on the traffic between the client and server or messing with the payload.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SSL certificates" id="idp11553376" class="calibre3"></a>The server needs to manage its own SSL certificates, which can become problematic when it is managing multiple machines. Some organizations take on their own certificate issuing process, which is an additional administrative and operational burden. Tools around managing this in an automated fashion are nowhere near as mature as they could be, and it isnâ€™t just the issuing process you have to handle. Self-signed certificates are not easily revokable, and thus require a lot more thought around disaster scenarios. See if you can dodge all this work by avoiding self-signing altogether.</p>

<p class="author">Another downside is that traffic sent via SSL cannot be cached by reverse proxies like Varnish or Squid. This means that if you need to cache traffic, it will have to be done either inside the server or inside the client. You can fix this by having a load balancer terminate the SSL traffic, and having the cache sit behind the load balancer.</p>

<p class="author">We also have to think about what happens if we are using an existing SSO solution, like SAML, that already has access to usernames and passwords. Do we want our basic service auth to use the same set of credentials, allowing us one process for issuing and revoking them? We could do this by having the service talk to the same directory service that backs our SSO solution. Alternatively, we could store the usernames and passwords ourselves inside the service, but then we run the risk of duplicating behavior.</p>

<p class="author">One note: in this approach, all the server knows is that the client has the username and password. We have no idea if this information is coming from a machine we expect; it could be coming from anyone on our network.</p>
