<p class="author">As we’ve already seen, in splitting a service into smaller parts, we need to also potentially split up how and where data is stored. This creates a problem, however, when it comes to one vital and common use case: reporting.</p>

<p class="author">A change in architecture as fundamental as moving to a microservices architecture will cause a lot of disruption, but it doesn’t mean we have to abandon everything we do. The audience of our reporting systems are users like any other, and we need to consider their needs. It would be arrogant to fundamentally change our architecture and just ask them to adapt. While I’m not suggesting that the space of reporting isn’t ripe for disruption — it certainly is — there is value in determining how to work with existing processes first. Sometimes we have to pick our battles.</p>
