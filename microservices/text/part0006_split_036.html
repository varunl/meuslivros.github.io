<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="user interfaces" data-secondary="API granularity" id="idp10057648" class="calibre3"></a>Over the last couple of years, organizations have started to move away from thinking that web or mobile should be treated differently; they are instead thinking about digital more holistically. What is the best way for our customers to use the services we offer? And what does that do to our system architecture? The understanding that we cannot predict exactly how a customer might end up interacting with our company has driven adoption of more granular APIs, like those delivered by microservices. By combining the capabilities our services expose in different ways, we can curate different experiences for our customers on their desktop application, mobile device, wearable device, or even in physical form if they visit our brick-and-mortar store.</p>

<p class="author">So think of user interfaces as compositional layers â€” places where we weave together the various strands of the capabilities we offer. So with that in mind, how do we pull all these strands together?</p>
