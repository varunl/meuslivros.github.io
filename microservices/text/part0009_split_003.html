<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="unit tests" data-secondary="scope of" id="idp11098656" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="test-driven design (TDD)" id="idp11099632" class="calibre3"></a>These are tests that typically test a single function or method call. The tests generated as a side effect of <em class="calibre4">test-driven design</em> (TDD) will fall into this category, as do the sorts of tests generated by techniques such as property-based testing. We’re not launching services here, and are limiting the use of external files or network connections. In general, you want a large number of these sorts of tests. Done right, they are very, very fast, and on modern hardware you could expect to run many thousands of these in less than a minute.</p>

<p class="author">These are tests that help us developers and so would be <em class="calibre4">technology-facing</em>, not <em class="calibre4">business-facing</em>, in Marick’s terminology. They are also where we hope to catch most of our bugs. So, in our example, when we think about the customer service, unit tests would cover small parts of the code in isolation, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="part0009_split_003.html#a63-example-unit-test-scope" class="calibre3">Figure 7-4</a>.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="unit tests" data-secondary="goals of" id="idp11106048" class="calibre3"></a>The prime goal of these tests is to give us very fast feedback about whether our functionality is good. Tests can be important to support refactoring of code, allowing us to restructure our code as we go, knowing that our small-scoped tests will catch us if we make a mistake.</p>
