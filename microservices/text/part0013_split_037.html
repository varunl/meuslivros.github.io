<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AP system" data-secondary="vs. CP system" id="idp12262848" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="CP system" id="idp12263824" class="calibre3"></a>Which is right, AP or CP? Well, the reality is <em class="calibre4">it depends</em>. As the people building the system, we know the trade-off exists. We know that AP systems scale more easily and are simpler to build, and we know that a CP system will require more work due to the challenges in supporting distributed consistency. But we may not understand the business impact of this trade-off. For our inventory system, if a record is out of date by five minutes, is that OK? If the answer is yes, an AP system might be the answer. But what about the balance held for a customer in a bank? Can that be out of date? Without knowing the context in which the operation is being used, we canâ€™t know the right thing to do. Knowing about the CAP theorem just helps you understand that this trade-off exists and what questions to ask.</p>
