<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="microservices vs. monolithic systems" id="idp10499664" class="calibre3"></a>Deploying a monolithic application is a fairly straightforward process. Microservices, with their interdependence, are a different kettle of fish altogether. If you don’t approach deployment right, it’s one of those areas where the complexity can make your life a misery. In this chapter, we’re going to look at some techniques and technology that can help us when deploying microservices into fine-grained architectures.</p>

<p class="author">We’re going to start off, though, by taking a look at continuous integration and continuous delivery. These related but different concepts will help shape the other decisions we’ll make when thinking about what to build, how to build it, and how to deploy it.</p>
