It therefore follows that we would like our teams aligned along bounded contexts too. This has multiple benefits. First, a team will find it easier to grasp domain concepts within a bounded context, as they are interrelated. Second, services within a bounded context are more likely to be services that talk to each other, making system design and release coordination easier. Finally, in terms of how the delivery team interacts with the business stakeholders, it becomes easier for the team to create good relationships with the one or two experts in that area.</p>
