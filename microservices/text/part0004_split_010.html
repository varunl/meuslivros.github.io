One of the key ways to identify what should be constant from service to service is to define what a well-behaved, good service looks like. What is a “good citizen” service in your system? What capabilities does it need to have to ensure that your system is manageable and that one bad service doesn’t bring down the whole system? And, as with people, what a good citizen is in one context does not reflect what it looks like somewhere else. Nonetheless, there are some common characteristics of well-behaved services that I think are fairly important to observe. These are the few key areas where allowing too much divergence can result in a pretty torrid time. As Ben Christensen from Netflix puts it, when we think about the bigger picture, “it needs to be a cohesive system made of many small parts with autonomous lifecycles but all coming together.” So we need to find the balance between optimizing for autonomy of the individual microservice without losing sight of the bigger picture. Defining clear attributes that each service should have is one way of being clear as to where that balance sits.</p>
