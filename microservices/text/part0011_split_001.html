In the context of security, <em class="calibre4">authentication</em> is the process by which we confirm that a party is who she says she is. For a human, you typically authenticate a user by having her type in her username and password. We assume that only she has access to this information, and therefore that the person entering this information must be her. Other, more complex systems exist as well, of course. My phone now lets me use my fingerprint to confirm that I am who I say I am. Generally, when we’re talking abstractly about who or what is being authenticated, we refer to that party as the <em class="calibre4">principal</em>.</p>

<p class="author"><em class="calibre4">Authorization</em> is the mechanism by which we map from a principal to the action we are allowing her to do. Often, when a principal is authenticated, we will be given information about her that will help us decide what we should let her do. We might, for example, be told what department or office she works in — pieces of information that our systems can use to decide what she can and cannot do.</p>

<p class="author">For single, monolithic applications, it is common for the application itself to handle authentication and authorization for you. Django, the Python web framework, comes out of the box with user management, for example. When it comes to distributed systems, though, we need to think of more advanced schemes. We don’t want everyone to have to log in separately for different systems, using a different username and password for each. The aim is to have a single identity that we can authenticate once.</p>
