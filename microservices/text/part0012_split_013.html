We want the code to be of decent quality, and the service itself to exhibit some sort of consistency in how it is put together. We also want to make sure that changes being made now don’t make future planned changes much harder than they need to be. This means that we need to adopt the same patterns used in normal open source internally too, which means separating out a group of trusted committers (the core team), and untrusted committers (people from outside the team submitting changes).</p>

<p class="author">The core team needs to have some way of vetting and approving the changes. It needs to make sure the changes are idiomatically consistent — that is, that they follow the general coding guidelines of the rest of the codebase. The people doing the vetting are therefore going to have to spend time working with the submitters to make sure the change is of sufficient quality.</p>

<p class="author">Good gatekeepers put a lot of work into this, communicating clearly with the submitters and encouraging good behavior. Bad gatekeepers can use this as an excuse to exert power over others or have religious wars about arbitrary technical decisions. Having seen both sets of behavior, I can tell you one thing is clear: either way it takes time. When considering allowing untrusted committers to submit changes to your codebase, you have to decide if the overhead of being a gatekeeper is worth the trouble: could the core team be doing better things with the time it spends vetting patches?</p>
