<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices" data-secondary="deployment ease of" id="idp4052080" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="microservices vs. monolithic systems" id="idp4053056" class="calibre3"></a>A one-line change to a million-line-long monolithic application requires the whole application to be deployed in order to release the change. That could be a large-impact, high-risk deployment. In practice, large-impact, high-risk deployments end up happening infrequently due to understandable fear. Unfortunately, this means that our changes build up and build up between releases, until the new version of our application hitting production has masses of changes. And the bigger the delta between releases, the higher the risk that we’ll get something wrong!</p>

<p class="author">With microservices, we can make a change to a single service and deploy it independently of the rest of the system. This allows us to get our code deployed faster. If a problem does occur, it can be isolated quickly to an individual service, making fast rollback easy to achieve. It also means we can get our new functionality out to customers faster. This is one of the main reasons why organizations like Amazon and Netflix use these architectures — to ensure they remove as many impediments as possible to getting software out the door.</p>

<p class="author">The technology in this space has changed greatly in the last couple of years, and we’ll be looking more deeply into the topic of deployment in a microservice world in <a data-type="xref" href="part0008_split_000.html#deployment-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
