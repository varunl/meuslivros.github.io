<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="third-party software" data-secondary="customization of" id="idp10191072" class="calibre3"></a>Many tools that enterprise organizations purchase sell themselves on their ability to be heavily customized <em class="calibre4">just for you</em>. Beware! Often, due to the nature of the tool chain you have access to, the cost of customization can be more expensive than building something bespoke from scratch! If you’ve decided to buy a product but the particular capabilities it provides aren’t that special to you, it might make more sense to change how your organization works rather than embark on complex customization.</p>

<p class="author">Content management systems are a great example of this danger. I have worked with multiple CMSes that by design do not support continuous integration, that have terrible APIs, and for which even a minor-point upgrade in the underlying tool can break any customizations you have made.</p>

<p class="author">Salesforce is especially troublesome in this regard. For many years it has pushed its Force.com platform, which requires the use of a programming language, Apex, that exists only within the Force.com ecosystem!</p>
