Hopefully we’ve done everything we can to ensure attackers cannot breach our network, and also that they cannot breach our applications or operating systems to get access to the underlying close up. However, we need to be prepared in case they do — defense in depth is key.</p>

<p class="author">Many of the high-profile security breaches involve data at rest being acquired by an attacker, and that data being readable by the attacker. This is either because the data was stored in an unencrypted form, or because the mechanism used to protect the data had a fundamental flaw.</p>

<p class="author">The mechanisms by which secure information can be protected are many and varied, but whichever approach you pick there are some general things to bear in mind.</p>
