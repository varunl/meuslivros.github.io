<p class="author">The fact that the order was captured and placed might be enough for us, and we may decide to retry the insertion into the warehouse’s picking table at a later date. We could queue up this part of the operation in a queue or logfile, and try again later. For some sorts of operations this makes sense, but we have to assume that a retry would fix it.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="eventual consistency" id="idp10374752" class="calibre3"></a>In many ways, this is another form of what is called <em class="calibre4">eventual consistency</em>. Rather than using a transactional boundary to ensure that the system is in a consistent state when the transaction completes, instead we accept that the system will get itself into a consistent state at some point in the future. This approach is especially useful with business operations that might be long-lived. We’ll discuss this idea in more depth in <a data-type="xref" href="part0013_split_000.html#at-scale-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 11</a> when we cover scaling patterns.</p>
