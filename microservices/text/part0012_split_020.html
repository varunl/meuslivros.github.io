<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="system design" data-secondary="accountability and" id="idp11852768" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="accountability" id="idp11853744" class="calibre3"></a>We have to accept that in a microservice environment, it is harder for a developer to just think about writing code in his own little world. He has to be more aware of the implications of things like calls across network boundaries, or the implications of failure. We’ve also talked about the ability of microservices to make it easier to try out new technologies, from data stores to languages. But if you’re moving from a world where you have a monolithic system, where the majority of your developers have just had to use one language and remain completely oblivious to the operational concerns, then throwing them into the world of microservices may be a rude awakening for them.</p>

<p class="author">Likewise, pushing power into development teams to increase autonomy can be fraught. People who have in the past thrown work over the wall to someone else are accustomed to having someone else to blame, and may not feel comfortable being fully accountable for their work. You may even find contractual barriers to having your developers carry support pagers for the systems they support!</p>

<p class="author">Although this book has mostly been about technology, people are not just a side issue to be considered; they are the people who built what you have now, and will build what happens next. Coming up with a vision for how things should be done without considering how your current staff will feel about this or without considering what capabilities they have is likely to lead to a bad place.</p>

<p class="author">Each organization has its own set of dynamics around this topic. Understand your staff’s appetite to change. Don’t push them too fast! Maybe you still have a separate team handle frontline support or deployment for a short period of time, giving your developers time to adjust to other new practices. You may, however, have to accept that you need different sorts of people in your organization to make all this work. Whatever your approach, understand that you need to be clear in articulating the responsibilities of your people in a microservices world, and also be clear why those responsibilities are important to you. This can help you see what your skill gaps might be, and think about how to close them. For many people, this will be a pretty scary journey. Just remember that without people on board, any change you might want to make could be doomed from the start.</p>
