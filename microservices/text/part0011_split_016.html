<p class="author">Assuming everything should be encrypted can simplify things somewhat. There is no guesswork about what should or should not be protected. However, you’ll still need to think about what data can be put into logfiles to help problem identification, and the computational overhead of encrypting everything can become pretty onerous, needing more powerful hardware as a result. This is even more challenging when you’re applying database migrations as part of refactoring schemas. Depending on the changes being made, the data may need to be decrypted, migrated, and re-encrypted.</p>

<p class="author">By subdividing your system into more fine-grained services, you might identify an entire data store that can be encrypted wholesale, but even then it is unlikely. Limiting this encryption to a known set of tables is a sensible approach.</p>
