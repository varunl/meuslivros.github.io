<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="user interfaces" data-secondary="constraints" id="idp10061568" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="constraints" id="idp10062544" class="calibre3"></a>Constraints are the different forms in which our users interact with our system. On a desktop web application, for example, we consider constraints such as what browser visitors are using, or their resolution. But mobile has brought a whole host of new constraints. The way our mobile applications communicate with the server can have an impact. It isn’t just about pure bandwidth concerns, where the limitations of mobile networks can play a part. Different sorts of interactions can drain battery life, leading to some cross customers.</p>

<p class="author">The nature of interactions changes, too. I can’t easily right-click on a tablet. On a mobile phone, I may want to design my interface to be used mostly one-handed, with most operations being controlled by a thumb. Elsewhere, I might allow people to interact with services via SMS in places where bandwidth is at a premium — the use of SMS as an interface is huge in the global south, for example.</p>

<p class="author">So, although our core services — our core offering — might be the same, we need a way to adapt them for the different constraints that exist for each type of interface. When we look at different styles of user interface composition, we need to ensure that they address this challenge. Let’s look at a few models of user interfaces to see how this might be achieved.</p>
