<p class="author">To maximize the autonomy that microservices make possible, we need to constantly be looking for the chance to delegate decision making and control to the teams that own the services themselves. This process starts with embracing <em class="calibre4">self-service</em> wherever possible, allowing people to deploy software on demand, making development and testing as easy as possible, and avoiding the need for separate teams to perform these activities.</p>

<p class="author">Ensuring that <em class="calibre4">teams own their services</em> is an important step on this journey, making teams responsible for the changes that are made, ideally even having them decide when to release those changes. Making use of <em class="calibre4">internal open source</em> ensures that  people can make changes on services owned by other teams, although remember that this requires work to implement. <em class="calibre4">Align teams to the organization</em> to ensure that Conwayâ€™s law works for you, and help your team become domain experts in the business-focused services they are creating. Where some overarching guidance is needed, try to embrace a <em class="calibre4">shared governance</em> model where people from each team collectively share responsibility for evolving the technical vision of the system.</p>

<p class="author">This principle can apply to architecture too. Avoid approaches like enterprise service bus or orchestration systems, which can lead to centralization of business logic and dumb services. Instead, <em class="calibre4">prefer choreography over orchestration</em> and <em class="calibre4">dumb middleware, with smart endpoints</em> to ensure that you keep associated logic and data within service boundaries, helping keep things cohesive.</p>
