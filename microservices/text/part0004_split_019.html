What do I mean by <em class="calibre4">governance</em>? It turns out the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) has a pretty good definition:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre19">
<div class="preface">Governance ensures that enterprise objectives are achieved by evaluating stakeholder needs, conditions and options; setting direction through prioritisation and decision making; and monitoring performance, compliance and progress against agreed-on direction and objectives.</div>

<p class="author">Governance can apply to multiple things in the forum of IT. We want to focus on the aspect of technical governance, something I feel is the job of the architect. If one of the architect’s jobs is ensuring there is a technical vision, then governance is about ensuring what we are building matches this vision, and evolving the vision if needed.</p>

<p class="author">Architects are responsible for a lot of things. They need to ensure there is a set of principles that can guide development, and that these principles match the organization’s strategy. They need to make sure as well that these principles don’t require working practices that make developers miserable. They need to keep up to date with new technology, and know when to make the right trade-offs. This is an awful lot of responsibility. All that, and they also need to carry people with them — that is, to ensure that the colleagues they are working with understand the decisions being made and are brought in to carry them out. Oh, and as we’ve already mentioned: they need to spend some time with the teams to understand the impact of their decisions, and perhaps even code too.</p>

<p class="author">A tall order? Absolutely. But I am firmly of the opinion that they shouldn’t do this alone. A properly functioning governance group can work together to share the work and shape the vision.</p>

<p class="author">Normally, governance is a group activity. It could be an informal chat with a small enough team, or a more structured regular meeting with formal group membership for a larger scope. This is where I think the principles we covered earlier should be discussed and changed as required. This group needs to be led by a technologist, and to consist predominantly of people who are executing the work being governed. This group should also be responsible for tracking and managing technical risks.</p>

<p class="author">A model I greatly favor is having the architect chair the group, but having the bulk of the group drawn from the technologists of each delivery team — the leads of each team at a minimum. The architect is responsible for making sure the group works, but the group as a whole is responsible for governance. This shares the load, and ensures that there is a higher level of buy-in. It also ensures that information flows freely from the teams into the group, and as a result, the decision making is much more sensible and informed.</p>

<p class="author">Sometimes, the group may make decisions with which the architect disagrees. At this point, what is the architect to do? Having been in this position before, I can tell you this is one of the most challenging situations to face. Often, I take the approach that I should go with the group decision. I take the view that I’ve done my best to convince people, but ultimately I wasn’t convincing enough. The group is often much wiser than the individual, and I’ve been proven wrong more than once! And imagine how disempowering it can be for a group to have been given space to come up with a decision, and then ultimately be ignored. But sometimes I have overruled the group. But why, and when? How do you pick the lines?</p>

<p class="author">Think about teaching children to ride a bike. You can’t ride it for them. You watch them wobble, but if you stepped in every time it looked like they might fall off, then they’d never learn, and in any case they fall off far less than you think they will! But if you see them about to veer into traffic, or into a nearby duck pond, then you have to step in. Likewise, as an architect, you need to have a firm grasp of when, figuratively, your team is steering into a duck pond. You also need to be aware that even if you know you are right and overrule the team, this can undermine your position and also make the team feel that they don’t have a say. Sometimes the right thing is to go along with a decision you don’t agree with. Knowing when to do this and when not to is tough, but is sometimes vital.</p>
