<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="database decomposition" data-secondary="overview of" id="idp10495936" class="calibre3"></a>We decompose our system by finding seams along which service boundaries can emerge, and this can be an incremental approach. By getting good at finding these seams and working to reduce the cost of splitting out services in the first place, we can continue to grow and evolve our systems to meet whatever requirements come down the road. As you can see, some of this work can be painstaking. But the very fact that it can be done incrementally means there is no need to fear this work.</p>

<p class="author">So now we can split our services out, but we’ve introduced some new problems too. We have many more moving parts to get into production now! So next up we’ll dive into the world of deployment.</p>
