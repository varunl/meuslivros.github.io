<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="continuous integration checklist" id="idp10511424" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="continuous integration (CI)" data-secondary="checklist for" id="idp10512464" class="calibre3"></a>I suspect you are probably using continuous integration in your own organization. If not, you should start. It is a key practice that allows us to make changes quickly and easily, and without which the journey into microservices will be painful. That said, I have worked with many teams who, despite saying that they do CI, aren’t actually doing it at all. They confuse the use of a CI tool with adopting the practice of CI. The tool is just something that enables the approach.</p>

<p class="author">I really like Jez Humble’s three questions he asks people to test if they really understand what CI is about:</p>

<div class="variable_list_term">Do you check in to mainline once per day?</div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">You need to make sure your code integrates. If you don’t check your code together with everyone else’s changes frequently, you end up making future integration harder. Even if you are using short-lived branches to manage changes, integrate as frequently as you can into a single mainline branch.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="variable_list_term">Do you have a suite of tests to validate your changes?</div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">Without tests, we just know that syntactically our integration has worked, but we don’t know if we have broken the behavior of the system. CI without some verification that our code behaves as expected isn’t CI.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="variable_list_term">When the build is broken, is it the #1 priority of the team to fix it?</div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">A passing green build means our changes have safely been integrated. A red build means the last change possibly did not integrate. You need to stop all further check-ins that aren’t involved in fixing the builds to get it passing again. If you let more changes pile up, the time it takes to fix the build will increase drastically. I’ve worked with teams where the build has been broken for days, resulting in substantial efforts to eventually get a passing build.</div>
