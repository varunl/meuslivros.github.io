<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="integration" data-secondary="guidelines for" id="idp10230656" class="calibre3"></a>We’ve looked at a number of different options around integration, and I’ve shared my thoughts on what choices are most likely to ensure our microservices remain as decoupled as possible from their other collaborators:</p>

<ul class="stafflist">
<li class="calibre5">
Avoid database integration at all costs.
</li>
<li class="calibre5">
Understand the trade-offs between REST and RPC, but strongly consider REST as a good starting point for request/response integration.
</li>
<li class="calibre5">
Prefer choreography over orchestration.
</li>
<li class="calibre5">
Avoid breaking changes and the need to version by understanding Postel’s Law and using tolerant readers.
</li>
<li class="calibre5">
Think of user interfaces as compositional layers.
</li>
</ul>

<p class="author">We covered quite a lot here, and weren’t able to go into depth on all of these topics. Nonetheless, this should be a good foundation to get you going and point you in the right direction if you want to learn more.</p>

<p class="author">We also spent some time looking at how to work with systems that aren’t completely under our control in the form of COTS products. It turns out that this description can just as easily apply to software we wrote!</p>

<p class="author">Some of the approaches outlined here apply equally well to <em class="calibre4">legacy</em> software, but what if we want to tackle the often-monumental task of bringing these older systems to heel and decomposing them into more usable parts? We’ll discuss that in detail in the next chapter.</p>
