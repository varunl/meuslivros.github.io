Well, to keep consistency, each database node needs to know the copy of the data it has is the same as the other database node. Now in the partition, if the database nodes can’t talk to each other, they cannot coordinate to ensure consistency. We are unable to guarantee consistency, so our only option is to refuse to respond to the request. In other words, we have sacrificed availability. Our system is consistent and partition tolerant, or CP. In this mode our service would have to work out how to degrade functionality until the partition is healed and the database nodes can be resynchronized.</p>

<p class="author">Consistency across multiple nodes is really hard. There are few things (perhaps nothing) harder in distributed systems. Think about it for a moment. Imagine I want to read a record from the local database node. How do I know it is up to date? I have to go and ask the other node. But I also have to ask that database node to not allow it to be updated while the read completes; in other words, I need to initiate a transactional read across multiple database nodes to ensure consistency. But in general people don’t do transactional reads, do they? Because transactional reads are slow. They require locks. A read can block an entire system up. All consistent systems require some level of locking to do their job.</p>

<p class="author">As we’ve already discussed, distributed systems have to expect failure. Consider our transactional read across a set of consistent nodes. I ask a remote node to lock a given record while the read is initiated. I complete the read, and ask the remote node to release its lock, but now I can’t talk to it. What happens now? Locks are really hard to get right even in a single process system, and are significantly more difficult to implement well in a distributed system.</p>

<p class="author">Remember when we talked about distributed transactions in <a data-type="xref" href="part0007_split_000.html#splitting-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 5</a>? The core reason they are challenging is because of this problem with ensuring consistency across multiple nodes.</p>

<p class="author">Getting multinode consistency right is so hard that I would strongly, <em class="calibre4">strongly</em> suggest that if you need it, don’t try to invent it yourself. Instead, pick a data store or lock service that offers these characteristics. Consul, for example, which we’ll discuss shortly, implements a strongly consistent key/value store designed to share configuration between multiple nodes. Along with “Friends don’t let friends write their own crypto” should go “Friends don’t let friends write their own distributed consistent data store.” If you think you need to write your own CP data store, read all the papers on the subject first, then get a PhD, and then look forward to spending a few years getting it wrong. Meanwhile, I’ll be using something off the shelf that does it for me, or more likely trying <em class="calibre4">really hard</em> to build eventually consistent AP systems instead.</p>
