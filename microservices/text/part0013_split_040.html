<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices at scale" data-secondary="service discovery" id="idp12280288" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="service discovery" id="idp12281296" class="calibre3"></a>Once you have more than a few microservices lying around, your attention inevitably turns to knowing where on earth everything is. Perhaps you want to know what is running in a given environment so you know what you should be monitoring. Maybe it’s as simple as knowing where your accounts service is so that those microservices that use it know where to find it. Or perhaps you just want to make it easy for developers in your organization to know what APIs are available so they don’t reinvent the wheel. Broadly speaking, all of these use cases fall under the banner of <em class="calibre4">service discovery</em>. And as always with microservices, we have quite a few different options at our disposal for dealing with it.</p>

<p class="author">All of the solutions we’ll look at handle things in two parts. First, they provide some mechanism for an instance to register itself and say, “I’m here!” Second, they provide a way to find the service once it’s registered. Service discovery gets more complicated, though, when we are considering an environment where we are constantly destroying and deploying new instances of services. Ideally, we’d want whatever solution we pick to cope with this.</p>

<p class="author">Let’s look at some of the most common solutions to service delivery and consider our options.</p>
