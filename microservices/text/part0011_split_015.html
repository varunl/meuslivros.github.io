<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="key storage" id="idp11628768" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="API key-based authentication" id="idp11629744" class="calibre3"></a>As has been covered so far, encryption relies on an algorithm taking the data to be encrypted and a key and then producing the encrypted data. So, where is your key stored? Now if I am encrypting my data because I am worried about someone stealing my whole database, and I store the key I use in the same database, then I haven’t really achieved much! Therefore, we need to store the keys somewhere else. But where?</p>

<p class="author">One solution is to use a separate security appliance to encrypt and decrypt data. Another is to use a separate key vault that your service can access when it needs a key. The lifecycle management of the keys (and access to change them) can be a vital operation, and these systems can handle this for you.</p>

<p class="author">Some databases even include built-in support for encryption, such as SQL Server’s Transparent Data Encryption, that aim to handle this in a transparent fashion. Even if your database of choice does, research how the keys are handled and understand if the threat you are protecting against is actually being mitigated.</p>

<p class="author">Again, this stuff is complex. Avoid implementing your own, and do some good research!</p>
