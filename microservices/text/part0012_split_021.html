<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Conway's law" data-secondary="summary of" id="idp11859760" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="system design" data-secondary="overview of" id="idp11860736" class="calibre3"></a>Conway’s law highlights the perils of trying to enforce a system design that doesn’t match the organization. This leads us to trying to align service ownership to colocated teams, which themselves are aligned around the same bounded contexts of the organization. When the two are not in alignment, we get tension points as outlined throughout this chapter. By recognizing the link between the two, we’ll make sure the system we are trying to build makes sense for the organization we’re building it for.</p>

<p class="author">Some of what we covered here touched on the challenges of working with organizations at scale. However, there are other technical considerations that we need to worry about when our systems start to grow beyond a few discrete services. We’ll address those next.</p>
