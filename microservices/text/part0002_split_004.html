<p class="author">This book is primarily organized in a topic-based format. As such, you may want to jump into the specific topics that interest you the most. While I have done my best to reference terms and ideas in the earlier chapters, I’d like to think that even people who consider themselves fairly experienced  will find something of interest in all chapters here. I would certainly suggest that you take a look at <a data-type="xref" href="part0004_split_000.html#architect-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 2</a>, which touches on the breadth of the topic as well as providing some framing for how I go about things in case if you want to dive deeper into some of the later topics.</p>

<p class="author">For people new to the subject, I’ve structured the chapters in a way that I hope will make sense to read from beginning to end.</p>

<p class="author">Here is an overview of what we cover:</p>

<div class="variable_list_term"><a href="part0003_split_000.html#why-services-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 1, Microservices</a></div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">We’ll begin with an introduction to microservices, including the key benefits as well as some of the downsides.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="variable_list_term"><a href="part0004_split_000.html#architect-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 2, The Evolutionary Architect</a></div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">This chapter discusses the difficulties we face in terms of making trade-offs as architects, and covers specifically just how many things we need to think about with microservices.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="variable_list_term"><a href="part0005_split_000.html#modelling-services-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 3, How to Model Services</a></div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">Here we’ll start to define the boundary of microservices, using techniques from domain-driven design to help focus our thinking.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="variable_list_term"><a href="part0006_split_000.html#integration-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 4, Integration</a></div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">This is where we start getting a bit deeper into specific technology implications, as we discuss what sorts of service collaboration techniques will help us most. We’ll also delve into the topic of user interfaces and integrating with legacy and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="variable_list_term"><a href="part0007_split_000.html#splitting-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 5, Splitting the Monolith</a></div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">Many people get interested in microservices as an antidote to large, hard-to-change monolithic systems, and this is exactly what we’ll cover in detail in this chapter.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="variable_list_term"><a href="part0008_split_000.html#deployment-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 6, Deployment</a></div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">Although this book is primarily theoretical, few topics in the book have been as impacted by recent changes in technology as deployment, which we’ll explore here.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="variable_list_term"><a href="part0009_split_000.html#testing-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 7, Testing</a></div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">This chapter goes deep into the topic of testing, an area of particular concern when handling the deployment of multiple discrete services. Of particular note will be the role that consumer-driven contracts can play in helping us ensure the quality of our software.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="variable_list_term"><a href="part0010_split_000.html#monitoring-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 8, Monitoring</a></div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">Testing our software before production doesn’t help if problems occur once we go live, and this chapter explores how we can monitor our fine-grained systems and deal with some of the emergent complexity of distributed systems.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="variable_list_term"><a href="part0011_split_000.html#security-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 9, Security</a></div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">Here we’ll examine the security aspects of microservices and consider how to handle user-to-service and service-to-service authentication and authorization. Security is a very important topic in computing, one that is all too readily ignored. Although I am in no way a security expert, I hope that this chapter will at least help you consider some of the aspects you need to be aware of when building systems, and microservice systems in particular.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="variable_list_term"><a href="part0012_split_000.html#conways-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 10, Conway’s Law and System Design</a></div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">This chapter focuses on the interplay of organizational structure and architecture. Many organizations have realized that trouble will occur if you don’t keep the two in harmony. We’ll attempt to get to the bottom of this dilemma, and consider some different ways to align system design with the structure of your teams.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="variable_list_term"><a href="part0013_split_000.html#at-scale-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 11, Microservices at Scale</a></div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">This is where we start looking at doing all of this at scale, so that we can handle the increased chance of failure that can happen with large numbers of services, as well as large volumes of traffic.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="variable_list_term"><a href="part0014_split_000.html#bring-together-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 12, Bringing It All Together</a></div>
<blockquote class="variable_list_definition">
<div class="calibre8">The final chapter attempts to distill down the core essence of what makes microservices different. It includes a list of seven microservices principles, as well as a wrap-up of the key points of the book.</div>
