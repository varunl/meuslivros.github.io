<p class="author">We discussed the role that principles can play in <a data-type="xref" href="part0004_split_000.html#architect-chapter" class="calibre3">Chapter 2</a>. They are statements about how things should be done, and why we think they should be done that way. They help us frame the various decisions we have to make when building our systems. You should absolutely define your own principles, but I thought it worth spelling out what I see as being the key principles for microservice architectures, which you can see summarized in <a data-type="xref" href="part0014_split_001.html#a120-principles" class="calibre3">Figure 12-1</a>. These are the principles that will help us create small autonomous services that work well together. We’ve already covered everything here at least once so far, so nothing should be new, but there is value in distilling it down to its core essence.</p>

<p class="author">You can choose to adopt these principles wholesale, or perhaps tweak them to make sense in your own organization. But note the value that comes from using them in combination: the whole should be greater than the sum of the parts. So if you decide to drop one of them, make sure you understand what you’ll be missing.</p>

<p class="author">For each of these principles, I’ve tried to pull out some of the supporting practices that we have covered in the book. As the saying goes, there is more than one way to skin a cat: you might find your own practices to help deliver on these principles, but this should get you started.</p>
