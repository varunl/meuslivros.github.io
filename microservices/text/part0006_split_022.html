<p class="author">There are two main parts we need to consider here: a way for our microservices to emit events, and a way for our consumers to find out those events have happened.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="message brokers" id="idp6806848" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="RabbitMQ" id="idp6807552" class="calibre3"></a>Traditionally, message brokers like RabbitMQ try to handle both problems. Producers use an API to publish an event to the broker. The broker handles subscriptions, allowing consumers to be informed when an event arrives. These brokers can even handle the state of consumers, for example by helping keep track of what messages they have seen before. These systems are normally designed to be scalable and resilient, but that doesn’t come for free. It can add complexity to the development process, because it is another system you may need to run to develop and test your services. Additional machines and expertise may also be required to keep this infrastructure up and running. But once it does, it can be an incredibly effective way to implement loosely coupled, event-driven architectures. In general, I’m a fan.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="middleware" id="idp6843472" class="calibre3"></a>Do be wary, though, about the world of middleware, of which the message broker is just a small part. Queues in and of themselves are perfectly sensible, useful things. However, vendors tend to want to package lots of software with them, which can lead to more and more smarts being pushed into the middleware, as evidenced by things like the Enterprise Service Bus. Make sure you know what you’re getting: keep your middleware dumb, and keep the smarts in the endpoints.</p>

<p class="author"><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ATOM specification" id="idp6845056" class="calibre3"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="REST (Representational State Transfer)" data-secondary="ATOM specification" id="idp6845760" class="calibre3"></a>Another approach is to try to use HTTP as a way of propagating events. ATOM is a REST-compliant specification that defines semantics (among other things) for publishing feeds of resources. Many client libraries exist that allow us to create and consume these feeds. So our customer service could just publish an event to such a feed when our customer service changes. Our consumers just poll the feed, looking for changes. On one hand, the fact that we can reuse the existing ATOM specification and any associated libraries is useful, and we know that HTTP handles scale very well. However, HTTP is not good at low latency (where some message brokers excel), and we still need to deal with the fact that the consumers need to keep track of what messages they have seen and manage their own polling schedule.</p>

<p class="author">I have seen people spend an age implementing more and more of the behaviors that you get out of the box with an appropriate message broker to make ATOM work for some use cases. For example, the Competing Consumer pattern describes a method whereby you bring up multiple worker instances to compete for messages, which works well for scaling up the number of workers to handle a list of independent jobs. However, we want to avoid the case where two or more workers see the same message, as we’ll end up doing the same task more than we need to. With a message broker, a standard queue will handle this. With ATOM, we now need to manage our own shared state among all the workers to try to reduce the chances of reproducing effort.</p>

<p class="author">If you already have a good, resilient message broker available to you, consider using it to handle publishing and subscribing to events. But if you don’t already have one, give ATOM a look, but be aware of the sunk-cost fallacy. If you find yourself wanting more and more of the support that a message broker gives you, at a certain point you might want to change your approach.</p>

<p class="author">In terms of what we actually send over these asynchronous protocols, the same considerations apply as with synchronous communication. If you are currently happy with encoding requests and responses using JSON, stick with it.</p>
