<h2 id="chapter-16" class="calibre1">16 How to Start with Microservices</h2>

<p class="calibre3">As conclusion of the book this chapter shows what the start with
Microservices can look like. <a href="part0021.html#section16-1">Section 16.1</a> enumerates the different
advantages of Microservices once more to illustrate that there is not
only a single reason to introduce Microservices, but
several. <a href="part0021.html#section16-2">Section 16.2</a> describes several ways for introducing
Microservices – depending on the use context and the expected
advantages. <a href="part0021.html#section16-3">Section 16.3</a> finally follows up on the question whether
Microservices are more than just a hype.</p>

<h3 id="section16-1" class="calibre2">16.1 Why Microservices?</h3>

<p class="calibre3">Microservices entail a number of advantages such as (compare also
<a href="part0008.html#chapter-5">chapter 5</a>):</p>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">Microservices make it easier to implement agility for large
projects since teams can work independently.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Microservices can help to supplement and replace legacy
applications stepwise.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Microservice-based architectures allow for sustainable development
since they are less susceptible to architecture decay and because
individual Microservices can be easily replaced. This increases the
long-term maintainability of the system.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">In addition, there are technical reasons for Microservices such as
robustness and scalability.</li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre3">To prioritize these advantages and the additional ones mentioned in
<a href="part0008.html#chapter-5">chapter 5</a> should be the first step when considering the
adaptation of a Microservice-based architecture. Likewise the
challenges discussed in <a href="part0009.html#chapter-6">chapter 6</a> have to be evaluated
and, where necessary, strategies for dealing with these challenges
have to be devised.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Continuous Delivery and infrastructure play a prominent role in this
context. If the deployment processes are still manual, the expenditure
for operating a large number of Microservices is so high that their
introduction is hardly feasible. Unfortunately, many organizations
still have profound weaknesses especially in the area of Continuous
Delivery and infrastructure. In such a case Continuous Delivery should
be introduced alongside Microservices. Since Microservices are much
smaller than Deployment Monoliths, Continuous Delivery is also easier
with Microservices. Therefore, both approaches have synergies.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In addition the organizational level (<a href="part0017.html#chapter-13">chapter 13</a>) has
to be taken into account. When the scalability of agile processes
constitutes an important reason for introducing Microservices, the
agile processes should already be well established. For example, there
has to be a Product Owner per team, who also decides about all
features, as well as agile planning. The teams should also be
already largely self-reliant – otherwise in the end they might not make use of
the independence Microservices offer.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Introducing Microservices can solve more than just one problem. The
specific motivation for Microservices will differ between
projects. The large number of advantages can on its own be a good
reason for introducing Microservices. In the end the strategy for
introducing Microservices has to be adapted to the advantages that are
most important in the context of a specific project.</p>

<h3 id="section16-2" class="calibre2">16.2 Roads towards Microservices</h3>

<p class="calibre3">There are different approaches which pave the way towards
Microservices:</p>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">The most typical scenario is to start out with a monolith which is
converted stepwise into a multitude of Microservices. Usually,
different functionalities are transferred one by one into
Microservices. A driving force behind this conversion is often the
wish for an easier deployment. However, independent scaling and
achieving a more sustainable architecture can also be important
reasons.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">However, migrating from a monolith to Microservices can also occur
in a different manner. When for instance resilience is the main reason
for switching to Microservices, the migration can be started by first
adding technologies like Hystrix to the monolith. Afterwards the
system can be split into Microservices.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Starting a Microservice-based system from scratch is by far the
rarer scenario. Even in such a case a project can start by building a
monolith. However, it is more sensible to devise a first
coarse-grained domain architecture which leads to the first
Microservices. Thereby an infrastructure is created which supports
more than just one Microservice. This approach also allows teams to
already work independently on features. However, a fine-granular
division into Microservices right from the start often does not make
sense because it will probably have to be revised again later on.
Introducing the necessary profound changes into an already existing
Microservices architecture can be highly complex.</li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre3">Microservices are easy to combine with existing systems which
facilitates their introduction. A small Microservice as supplement to
an existing Deployment Monolith is rapidly written. If problems arise,
such a Microservice can also be rapidly removed again from the
system. Other technical elements can then be introduced in a stepwise
manner.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The easy combination of Microservices with legacy systems is an
essential reason for the fact that the introduction of Microservices
is quite simple and can immediately result in advantages.</p>

<h3 id="section16-3" class="calibre2">16.3 Microservice: Hype or Reality?</h3>

<p class="calibre3">Without doubt Microservices are an approach which is in the focus of
attention right now. This does not have to be bad – yet, such
approaches often are at second glance only a fashion and do not
solve any real problems.</p>

<p class="calibre3">However, the interest in Microservices is more than just a fashion or
hype:</p>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">As described in the introduction, Amazon has been employing
Microservices for many years. Likewise, many internet companies have
been following this approach for a long time. Therefore, Microservices
are not just a new fashion, but have already been used for a long time
behind the scenes in many companies before they became fashionable.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">For the Microservice pioneers the advantages associated with
Microservices were so profound that they were willing to invest a lot
of money into creating the not yet existing necessary
infrastructures. These infrastructures are nowadays available free of
cost as Open Source – Netflix is a prominent example. Therefore, it is
much easier nowadays to introduce Microservices.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">The trend towards agility and Cloud infrastructures is suitably
complemented by Microservices-based architectures: They enable the
scaling of agility and fulfill the demands of the Cloud in regards to
robustness and scalability.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Likewise Microservices as small deployment units support
Continuous Delivery which is employed by many enterprises to increase
software quality and to bring software more rapidly into production.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">There is more than one reason for Microservices. Therefore,
Microservices represent an improvement for many areas. Since there is
not a single reason for the introduction of Microservices, but a
number of them, it is more likely that even very diverse projects will
in the end really benefit from switching to Microservices.</li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre3">Presumably, everybody has already seen large, complex systems. Maybe
it is now the time to develop smaller systems and to profit from the
associated advantages. In any case there seem to be only very few
reasons arguing for monoliths – except for their lower technical
complexity.</p>

<h3 id="section16-4" class="calibre2">16.4 Conclusion</h3>

<p class="calibre3">Introducing Microservices makes sense for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">There is a plethora of advantages (discussed in
<a href="part0021.html#section16-1">section 16.1</a> and <a href="part0008.html#chapter-5">chapter 5</a>).</li>
  <li class="calibre14">The way to Microservices is evolutionary. It is not necessary to
start adopting Microservices for the whole system from the
beginning. Quite in contrast: A stepwise migration is the usual way
(<a href="part0021.html#section16-2">section 16.2</a>). Many different approaches can be
chosen in order to profit as
quickly as possible from the advantages Microservices offer.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">The start is reversible: If Microservices prove not to be suitable
for a certain project, they can easily be replaced again.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Microservices are clearly more than a hype
(<a href="part0021.html#section16-3">section 16.3</a>). For being just a hype they have been
in use for too long and have been too broadly adapted. Therefore, one
should at least experiment with Microservices – and this books invites
the reader in many places to do just that.</li>
