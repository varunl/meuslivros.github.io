<h2 id="chapter-7" class="calibre1">7 Microservices and SOA</h2>

<p class="calibre3">At first glance Microservices and SOA seem to have a lot in common:
Both approaches focus on the modularization of large systems into
services. Are SOA and Microservices indeed the same or are there
differences? Dissecting this question contributes to an in depth
understanding of Microservices. Besides, some ideas from the SOA field
are interesting for Microservice-based architectures. A SOA approach
can be advantageous when migrating to Microservices. It separates the
functionalities of the old applications into services, which can be
replaced or supplemented by Microservices.</p>

<p class="calibre3"><a href="part0010.html#section7-1">Section 7.1</a> defines the term “SOA” as well as the term
“service” within the SOA context. <a href="part0010.html#section7-2">Section 7.2</a> extends
this topic by highlighting the differences between SOA and
Microservices.</p>

<h3 id="section7-1" class="calibre2">7.1 What is SOA?</h3>

<p class="calibre3">SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) and Microservices share one
similarity: They lack an unambiguous definition. Therefore, this
section provides only one of the possible definitions. According to
other definitions Microservices and SOA are indeed identical
approaches. Eventually, both approaches are based on services and the
distribution of applications into services.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The term “service” is central for SOA.</p>

<p class="calibre3">A SOA service should have the following characteristics:</p>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">A service should comprise a domain functionality.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">A service can be used independently.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">It is available in the network.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Each service has an interface. Knowledge about the interface is
sufficient to use the service.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">The service can be used via different programming languages and
platforms.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">To make it easy to use the service is registered in a directory.
Via this directory clients search the service at run time and use it.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">The service should be coarse-grained in order to reduce
dependencies. Small services can only implement sensible
functionalities together with other services. Therefore, SOA focuses
rather on larger services.</li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre3">SOA services do not need to be newly implemented, but are already
present in the company applications. Introducing SOA means to make
these services available outside of those applications. Because of the
distribution of applications into services their use in different
contexts is facilitated. This is supposed to improve the flexibility
of the overall IT – that is the goal of SOA. Due to the distribution
into individual services it is possible to recycle services during the
implementation of business processes. This requires only to
orchestrate the individual services.</p>

  <figcaption class="calibre18">Fig. 15: Overview of a SOA landscape</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="calibre3"><a href="part0010.html#Fig15">Fig. 15</a> depicts a possible SOA landscape. Like the previous
examples this example is derived from the E-commerce field. There are
different systems in the SOA landscape:</p>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">The <em class="calibre20">CRM</em> (Customer Relationship Management) is an application,
which stores essential information about the customers. This
information comprises not only contact details, but also the history
of all transactions with the customer – telephone calls as well as
emails or orders. The CRM exposes services, which for instance support
the creation of a new customer, provide information about a customer or
generate reports for all customers.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">The <em class="calibre20">Order System</em> is in charge of order processing. It can receive
new orders, provide information about the order status or cancel an
order. Also this system provides access to the different
functionalities via individual services. These services might
have been added as additional interface to the system after the first version
was put into production.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">In the scheme CRM and the order system are the only systems. In
reality there would be certainly additional systems, for instance to
provide the product catalog. However, to illustrate a SOA landscape
these two systems suffice.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">For the systems to be able to call each other there is an
<em class="calibre20">integration platform</em>. This platform allows for the communication
between the services. It can newly compose the services by
orchestration. Orchestration can be mediated by a technology, which
models business processes and calls the individual services to execute
the different processes.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Therefore, <em class="calibre20">orchestration</em> is responsible for coordinating the
different services. The infrastructure is intelligent and can react
appropriately to the different messages. It contains the model of the
business processes and thus an important part of the business logic.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">SOA can be used via a <em class="calibre20">portal</em>. The portal is responsible for
providing the users with an interface for using the services. There can
be different portals: for instance one for the customers, one for
the support and one for internal employees. Likewise, the system can
be called via rich client applications or mobile Apps. From an
architectural perspective this does not make a difference: All such
systems use the different services to make them useable for a user.
Eventually, all these systems are a universal UI to be able to use all
services in the SOA.</li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre3">Each of these systems can be operated und further developed by an
individual team. In the example there could be one team each for the
CRM and the order system, and one additional team each for each portal
and finally one team taking care of integration and orchestration.</p>

<p class="calibre3"><a href="part0010.html#Fig16">Fig 16</a> shows how communication is structured in SOA
architecture. Users typically work with SOA via the portal. Thereby
business processes can be initiated, which then are implemented in the
orchestration layer. These processes use the services. Especially when
migrating from a Monolith to SOA users might still use a Monolith
via its own user interface. However, SOA usually aims for having a
portal as central user interface and an orchestration for implementing
processes.</p>

</figure>


<h5 id="leanpub-auto-introducing-soa" class="calibre15">Introducing SOA</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Introducing SOA is a strategic initiative involving different teams.
 In the end the aim is to distribute the entire company IT into
 separate services. The distribution supports the composition
 of services into new functionalities in a better manner. However, this is only possible
 when all systems in the entire organization have been adjusted. And
 only when so many services are available that business processes
 can be implemented by simple orchestration, SOA’s advantages are
 really evident. Therefore, the integration and orchestration
 technology has to be used in the entire IT to enable service
 communication and integration. This entails high investment costs as
 the entire IT landscape has to be changed. This is one of the main
 points of <a href="http://apsblog.burtongroup.com/2009/01/soa-is-dead-long-live-ser-%20vices.html">criticism</a> in regards to SOA.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The services can also be offered to other companies and users via
internet or private networks. Thus SOA is well suited to support
business concepts, which are based on the outsourcing of services or
the inclusion of external services. In an E-commerce application an
external provider could for instance offer simple services like
address validation or complex services like a credit check.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-services-in-a-soa" class="calibre15">Services in a SOA</h5>

<p class="calibre3">At least when introducing SOA based on old systems the SOA services
are only interfaces of large Deployment Monolith. One Monolith offers
several services. The services are built upon the existing
applications. Often it is not even necessary to adjust the internals
of a system in order to offer the services. Such a service typically
does not have a UI, instead it offers only an interface for other
applications. A UI exists only for all systems. It is also not part
of a service, but independent - for instance in the portal.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In addition, it is possible to implement smaller deployment units in a
SOA. The definition of SOA services does not limit the size of the
deployment units – quite contrary to Microservices where the size of
the deployment units is a defining feature.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-interfaces-and-versioning" class="calibre15">Interfaces and Versioning</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Service versioning in SOA is a special challenge. Service changes have
to be coordinated with the users of the respective service. Because of
this coordination requirement, changes to the interface of the services
are laborious. Service users are unlikely to adjust their own software
if they do not profit from the new interface. Therefore, old interface
versions frequently have to be supported as well. This means that
numerous interface versions have probably to be supported if a service
is used by many clients. This increases software complexity and
renders changes more difficult. After all, the correct functioning of
the old interfaces has to be ensured upon each new software release.
If data are supplemented, challenges arise because the old interfaces
do not support these data. This is no problem during reading. However,
when writing it can be difficult to create new data sets without the
additional data.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-external-interfaces" class="calibre15">External Interfaces</h5>

<p class="calibre3">If there are external users outside the company using the service,
interface changes get even more difficult. In the worst case the
service provider does not even know exactly who is using the service
since it is available to anonymous users in the Internet. In that case
it is nearly impossible to coordinate changes. Consequently,
switching off an old service version then gets nearly unfeasible. This
leads to a growing number of interface versions, and service changes
get more and more difficult. This problem concerns Microservices as
well (compare <a href="part0013.html#section9-6">section 9.6</a>).</p>

<p class="calibre3">The interface users are also facing challenges: If they need an
interface modification, they have to coordinate this with the team
offering the service. Then the changes have to be prioritized in relation
to all other changes and wishes of other teams. As discussed already,
an interface change is no easy task. Therefore, it can take quite a long time
till changes are in fact implemented. This hampers the further
development of the system.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-interfaces-enforce-a-coordination-of-deployments" class="calibre15">Interfaces Enforce a Coordination of Deployments</h5>

<p class="calibre3">After a change to the interface the deployment of the services has to
be coordinated. First the service has to be deployed, which offers the
new interface versions. Only then the service, which uses the new
interface, can be deployed. Since applications are mostly Deployment
Monoliths in the case of SOA, several services can always only be
deployed together. This renders the coordination of services more
difficult. In addition, the risk increases as the deployment of a
Monolith takes a long time and is hard to undo – just because the
changes are so extensive.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-coordination-and-orchestration" class="calibre15">Coordination and Orchestration</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Coordinating SOA via an orchestration in the integration layer poses a
number of challenges. In a way a Monolith is generated: All business
processes are echoed in this orchestration. This Monolith is often
even worse than the usual Monoliths as it is using all systems within
the enterprise IT. In extreme cases it can happen that the services
only undertake the data administration while all logic is found in the
orchestration. In such cases the entire SOA is in the end nothing else
than a Monolith, which is having its entire logic in the
orchestration.</p>

<p class="calibre3">However, even in other settings changes to SOA are not really easy:
Domains are divided into services in the different systems and into
business processes in orchestration. When a change to a functionality
also concerns services or the user interface, things get difficult:
Changing the business processes is relatively simple, but changing the
service is only possible by writing code and by deploying a new
version of the application providing the service. The necessary code
changes and the deployment can be very laborious. Thus, the
flexibility of SOA is lost, which was meant to arise from a simple
orchestration of services. Modifications of the user interface cause
changes to the portal or to the other user interface systems and
require likewise a new deployment.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-technologies" class="calibre15">Technologies</h5>

<p class="calibre3">SOA is an architecture approach and independent of a concrete
technology. However, a SOA has to define a common technology for the
communication between the services, like Microservices do. In
addition, a concrete technology needs to be set for the orchestration
of the services. Often introducing a SOA leads to the introduction of
complex technologies to allow for the integration and orchestration of
the services. There are special products, which support all
aspects of SOA. However, they are correspondingly complex, and their
features are hardly ever used to full capacity.</p>

<p class="calibre3">This technology can rapidly turn into a bottleneck. Many problems with
these technologies are attributed to SOA although SOA could be
implemented with other technologies as well. One of the problems is
the complexity of the web services protocols. SOA on its own is still
quite simple, however, in conjunction with the extensions from the
WS-* environment a complex protocol stack arises. WS-* is necessary
for transactions, security or other extensions. Complex protocols
exacerbate the interoperability – however, interoperability is a
prerequisite for a SOA.</p>

<p class="calibre3">An action on the user interface has to be processed by the
orchestration and the different services. These are distributed calls
within the network with associated overhead and latency. Moreover,
this communication runs via the central integration and orchestration
technology, which accordingly has to cope with numerous calls.</p>

<h3 id="section7-2" class="calibre2">7.2 Differences Between SOA and Microservices</h3>

<p class="calibre3">SOA and Microservices are related: Both aim at splitting
applications into services. It is also not easy to distinguish between
SOA and Microservices just because of what is happening in the
network. After all, in both architecture approaches many services
exchange information via the network.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-communication" class="calibre15">Communication</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Like Microservices SOA can be based on asynchronous communication or
synchronous communication. SOAs can be uncoupled by sending merely
events like “new order”. In such cases every SOA service can react to
the event with different logic. One service can write a bill and
another can initiate the delivery. The services are strongly uncoupled
since they only react to events without knowing the trigger for the
events. New services can easily be integrated into the system by
likewise reacting to such events.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-orchestration" class="calibre15">Orchestration</h5>

<p class="calibre3">However, already at the level of integration differences between SOA
and Microservices appear: In SOA the integration solution is also
responsible for orchestrating the services. A business process is
built up from services. In a Microservice-based architecture the
integration solution does not possess any intelligence. The
Microservices are responsible for communicating with the other
services. SOA attempts to use orchestration to gain additional
flexibility for the implementation of business processes. This will
only work out when services and user interface are stable and do not
frequently have to be modified.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-flexibility" class="calibre15">Flexibility</h5>

<p class="calibre3">For achieving the necessary flexibility Microservices on the other
hand exploit the fact that each Microservice can be easily changed and
brought into production. When the flexible business processes of SOA
are not sufficient, SOA forces the change of services into Deployment
Monolith or user interfaces in an additional Deployment Monolith.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Microservices place emphasis on isolation: Ideally a user interaction
is completely processed within one Microservice without the need to
call another Microservice. Therefore, changes required for new features
are limited to individual Microservices. SOA distributes the logic to
the portal, the orchestration and the individual services.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-microservices-project-level" class="calibre15">Microservices: Project Level</h5>

<p class="calibre3">However, the most important difference between SOA and Microservices
is the level at which the architecture aims. SOA considers the entire
enterprise. It defines how a multitude of systems within the
enterprise IT interacts. Microservices on the other hand represent an
architecture for an individual system. They are an alternative to
other modularization technologies. It would be conceivable to
implement a Microservice-based system with another modularization
technology and then to bring the system into production as a
Deployment Monolith without distributed services. An entire SOA spans
the entire enterprise IT. It has to look at different systems. An
alternative to a distributed approach is not conceivable. Accordingly,
the decision for a Microservice-based architecture can concern and be
limited to an individual project while the introduction and
implementation of SOA pertains to the entire enterprise.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The SOA scenario depicted in <a href="part0010.html#Fig15">Fig. 15</a> results in a
fundamentally different architecture (compare <a href="part0010.html#Fig17">Fig. 17</a>) if
<a href="http://slideshare.net/ewolff/micro-services-neither-micro-nor-service">implemented</a> using <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/archbeat/entry/podcast_show_notes_micro-services_roundtable">Microservices</a>:</p>


<figure id="Fig17" class="image">
  <img src="../images/00019.jpeg" alt="Fig. 17: CRM as Collection of Microservices" class="calibre17"/>
  <figcaption class="calibre18">Fig. 17: CRM as Collection of Microservices</figcaption>
</figure>


<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">Since Microservices refer to a single system, the architecture does
not need to comprise the entire IT with its different systems, but can
be limited to an individual system. In <a href="part0010.html#Fig17">Fig. 17</a> this system is the
CRM. Thus, implementing Microservices is relatively easy and not very
costly as it is sufficient to implement one individual project rather
than to change the entire IT landscape of the enterprise.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Accordingly, a Microservice-based architecture does not require an
integration technology to be introduced and used throughout the
company. The use of a specific integration and communication
technology is limited to the Microservice system - it is even possible
to use several approaches. For instance, a high-performance access
also to large data sets can be implemented by replicating the data in
the database. For access to other systems again other technologies can
be used. In case of SOA all services in the entire company need to be
accessible via a uniform technology. This requires a uniform
technology stack. Microservices focus on simpler technologies, which
do not have to fulfill as complex requirements as SOA suites.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">In addition, communication between Microservices is different:
Microservices employ simple communication systems without any
intelligence. Microservices call each other or send messages. The
integration technology does not implement an orchestration. A
Microservice can call several other Microservices and implement an
orchestration on its own. In that case, the logic for the
orchestration resides in the Microservice and not in an integration
layer. In the case of Microservices the integration solution contains 
no logic, because it would originate from different domains. This
conflicts with the distribution according to domains, which
Microservice-based architectures aim at.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">The use of the integration is also entirely different. Microservices
avoid communication with other Microservices by having the UI
integrated into the Microservice and due to their domain-based
distribution. SOA focuses on communication. SOA
obtains its flexibility by orchestration - this is accompanied by communication between
services. And in the case of Microservices the communication does not
necessarily have to be implemented via messaging or REST: An
integration at the UI level or via data replication is possible as
well.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">CRM as complete system is not really present anymore in a
Microservice-based architecture. Instead there is a collection of
Microservices, which each cover specific functionalities like reports
or forecasting transaction volume.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">While in SOA all functionalities of the CRM system are collected in
a single deployment unit, each service is an independent deployment
unit and can be brought into production independently of the other
services in the case of Microservice-based approaches. Depending on
the concrete technical infrastructure the services can be even smaller
than the ones depicted in <a href="part0010.html#Fig17">Fig. 17</a>.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Finally, the handling of UI is different: For Microservices the UI is
part of the Microservice, while SOA typically offers only services,
which then can be used by a portal.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">The division into UI and service in SOA has far reaching consequences:
To implement a new functionality including the UI in SOA, at least the
service has to be changed and the UI adjusted. This means that at
least two teams have to be coordinated. When other services in other
applications are used, even more teams are involved requiring
consequently an even greater coordination effort. In addition there
are also orchestration changes, which are implemented likewise by a
separate team. Microservices on the other hand attempt that an
individual team can bring a new functionality into production with as
little need for coordination with other teams as possible. Due to the
Microservice-based architecture, interfaces between layers, which
normally are between teams, are now within a team. This facilitates
the implementation of changes. The changes can be processed in one
team. If another team were involved, the changes had to be prioritized
in relation to other requirements.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Each Microservice can be developed and operated by one individual
team. This team is responsible for a specific domain and can implement
new requirements or changes to the domain completely independently of
other teams.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Moreover, the approach is different between SOA and Microservices:
SOA introduces only one new layer above the existing services in order
to combine applications in new ways. It aims at a flexible integration
of the existing applications. Microservices serve to change the
structure of the applications themselves – in pursuit of the goal to
make changes to applications easier.</li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre3">The communication relationships in case of Microservices are depicted
in <a href="part0010.html#Fig18">Fig. 18</a>: The user interacts with the UI, which is
implemented by the different Microservices. In addition, the
Microservices communicate with each other. There is no central UI or
orchestration.</p>


<figure id="Fig18" class="image">

  <figcaption class="calibre18">Fig. 18: Communication in the case of Microservices</figcaption>
</figure>


<h5 id="leanpub-auto-synergies" class="calibre15">Synergies</h5>

<p class="calibre3">There are definitely areas where Microservices and SOA have synergies.
In the end both approaches pursue the goal to resolve applications
into services. Such a step can be helpful when migrating an
application to Microservices: When the application is split into
SOA services, individual services can be replaced or supplemented by
Microservices. Certain calls can be processed by a Microservice while
other calls are still processed by the application. This allows to
migrate applications in a stepwise manner and to implement the
Microservices step by step.</p>

<p class="calibre3"><a href="part0010.html#Fig19">Fig. 19</a> shows an example: The upper most service of CRM is
supplemented by a Microservice. This Microservice now takes all calls
and can, if necessary, call the CRM. The second CRM service is
completely replaced by a Microservice. Thereby the CRM can be
complemented by new functionalities. At the same time, it is not
necessary to newly implement the entire CRM, instead Microservices can
complement it at selected places. <a href="part0012.html#section8-5">Section 8.5</a> presents
additional approaches how legacy applications can be replaced by
Microservices.</p>

</table>

<p class="calibre3">At the organizational level the approaches are very different: SOAs
place emphasis on the structure of the entire enterprise IT,
Microservices can be utilized in an individual project. SOAs focus on
an organization where some teams develop backend services, while
a different team implements the UI. In a Microservice-based approach one
team should implement everything to facilitate communication and
thereby speed up the implementation of features. That is not a goal of
SOA. In SOA a new feature can entail changes to numerous services and
thus require communication between a large number of
teams. Microservices try to avoid this.</p>

<p class="calibre3">At the technical level there are commonalities: Both concepts are
based on services. The service granularity can even be
similar. Because of these technical similarities it does not seem to
be so easy to distinguish SOA from Microservices. However, from
conceptual, architectural and organizational view points both
approaches have very different effects.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-essential-points-4" class="calibre15">Essential Points</h5>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">SOA and Microservices split applications into services, which

to this end.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">SOA aims at flexibility at the level of the enterprise IT by
orchestrating the services. This is a complex undertaking and only
works when the services do not need to be modified.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Microservices focus on individual projects and aim at facilitating
deployment and enabling parallel work on different services.</li>

    <p class="calibre3">A new functionality is supposed to be incorporated into the SOA
landscape depicted in <a href="part0010.html#Fig15">Fig. 15</a>. The CRM does not have support for
email campaigns. Therefore, a system for email campaigns has to be
implemented. It is supposed to contain a service for the creation
and execution of campaigns and a service for evaluating the results of
a campaign.</p>

  <p class="calibre3">An architect has to answer the following questions:</p>

  <ul class="calibre16">
    <li class="calibre14">Is the SOA infrastructure needed for integrating the two services?
The service for campaign evaluation needs a large amount of data.
      <ul class="calibre31">
        <li class="calibre14">Would it be better to use data replication, UI-level integration
or service calls for accessing the large amount of data?</li>
        <li class="calibre14">Which of these integration options is typically offered by SOA?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="calibre14">Should the service integrate into the existing portal or rather have
its own user interface? Which arguments favor the one or the other
option?</li>
    <li class="calibre14">Should the new functionality be implemented by the CRM team?</li>
