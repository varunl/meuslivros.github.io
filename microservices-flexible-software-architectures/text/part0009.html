<h2 id="chapter-6" class="calibre1">6 Challenges</h2>

<p class="calibre3">The distribution of a system into Microservices entails a higher
complexity. This leads to challenges at the technical level (compare
<a href="part0009.html#section6-1">section 6.1</a>) – for instance high latency times in the
network or the failure of individual services. However, also at the
level of software architecture there are a number of things to
consider – for instance because of the bad architecture changeability
(<a href="part0009.html#section6-2">section 6.2</a>). And finally, there are many more
components to be independently delivered so that operation and
infrastructure become more complex (<a href="part0009.html#section6-3">section 6.3</a>). These
challenges have to be dealt with when introducing Microservices.
Measures described in the following chapters show how to appropriately
handle these challenges.</p>

<h3 id="section6-1" class="calibre2">6.1 Technical Challenges</h3>

<p class="calibre3">Microservices are distributed systems. Calls between Microservices go
via the network. This affects the latency and thus the response times
of Microservices negatively. The already mentioned
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FirstLaw.html">first rule for distributed objects</a>
states that objects, if possible, should not be distributed (compare
<a href="part0007.html#section4-1">section 4.1</a>).</p>

<p class="calibre3">The reason for that is illustrated in <a href="part0009.html#Fig13">Fig. 13</a> A call has to
go via the network to reach the server, is processed there and has to
return to the caller. The latency just for network communication can
be around 0.5 ms in a computing center (compare
<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/ladis2009/talks/dean-keynote-ladis2009.pdf">here</a>).
Within this time a processor running at 3 Ghz can process about 1.5
million instructions. When a computation is redistributed to another
node, it should be checked whether local processing of the request
might not be faster. The latency can even increase further by
parameter marshaling and unmarshaling for a call and the result of a
call. On the other hand, network optimizations or connecting nodes to
the same network switch can improve the situation.</p>


<figure id="Fig13" class="image">

  <figcaption class="calibre18">Fig. 13: Latency for a call via the network</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="calibre3">The first rule for distributed objects and the warning to be aware of
the latency within the network dates back to the time when CORBA and
EJB were used. These technologies were often used for distributed Three
Tier Architectures (compare <a href="part0009.html#Fig14">Fig. 14</a>). For every client
request the web tier implements only the data rendering as HTML page.
The logic resides on another server, which is called via the network.
The data are deposited in the database and thus on an again other
server. When only data are to be shown, there is little happening in
the Middle Tier. The data are not processed, just forwarded. For
performance and latency, it would be much better to keep the logic on
the same server as the web tier. Though the distribution allows to
scale the Middle Tier independently, the system does not get faster
this way when it anyhow does not have much to do.</p>


<figure id="Fig14" class="image">
  <img src="../images/00016.jpeg" alt="Fig. 14: Three Tier Architecture" class="calibre17"/>
  <figcaption class="calibre18">Fig. 14: Three Tier Architecture</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="calibre3">For Microservices the situation is different as the UI is contained in
the Microservice. Calls between Microservices only take place when
Microservices need functionalities of other Microservices. If that is
often the case, this might be a hint that there are architectural
problems as the Microservices should be largely independent of each
other.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Practically, Microservice-based architectures function
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/distributed-objects-microservices.html">in spite</a>
of the challenges related to distribution. Still Microservices should
not communicate too much with each other in order to improve
performance and reduce latency.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-code-dependencies" class="calibre15">Code Dependencies</h5>

<p class="calibre3">The great advantage of Microservice-based architectures is the option
to independently deploy the individual services. However, this option
can be undone by code dependencies. If a library is used by several
Microservices and a new version of this library is supposed to be
rolled out, a coordinated deployment of several Microservices might be
required – precisely the scenario that should be prevented. Something
like that can for instance easily occur due to binary dependencies
where sometimes different versions are not compatible anymore. The
deployment has to be temporally coordinated in a way that all
Microservices are rolled out in a certain time interval and in a
defined order. Besides the code dependency has to be changed in all
Microservices, a process that has likewise to be prioritized and
coordinated across all involved teams. A binary level dependency is a
very tight technical coupling, which entails a very tight
organizational coupling.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Therefore Microservices propagate a Shared Nothing Approach where the
Microservices do not possess shared code. Microservices rather accept
code redundancy and resist the urge to reuse code in order to avoid
a close organizational link.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Code dependencies can be tolerable in certain situations. When a
Microservice offers for instance a client library, which supports
callers while using this Microservice, this does not necessarily have
negative consequences. The library depends on the interface of the
Microservice. If the interface is changed in a backward compatible
manner, also a caller having an old version of the client library can
still use the Microservice. The deployment remains uncoupled. However,
the client library can be the starting point to a code dependency. If
the client library contains for instance domain objects, this can be a
problem. In fact, if the client library contains the same code for the
domain objects, which is also internally used, changes to the internal
model will affect the clients. They might have to be deployed again
if need be. If the domain object contains logic, this logic can only
be modified when all clients are likewise deployed anew. This also
violates the idea of independently deployable Microservices.</p>

<aside class="calibre33">
  <h3 id="leanpub-auto-consequences-of-code-dependencies" class="calibre35">Consequences of Code Dependencies</h3>

  <p class="calibre3">Here is an example for the effects of code dependencies: User
authentication is a central function, which all services use. A
project has developed a service implementing the authentication.
Nowadays there are open source projects, which implement such things,
(<a href="part0012.html#section8-12">section 8.12</a>) so that an implementation of a
home-grown solution is rarely sensible anymore. In that project each
Microservice could use a library for facilitating the handling of the
authentication service. Accordingly, all Microservices have a code
dependency towards the authentication service. Changes to the
authentication service might require that the library has to be newly
rolled out. This in turn means that all Microservices have to be
modified and newly rolled out as well. In addition, the deployments of
the Microservices and the authentication service have to be
coordinated. This can easily cost a two-digit number of man days. Thus
authentication can hardly be changed anymore due to the code
dependency. If the authentication service could be deployed just like
that and if there were no code dependencies, which couple the deployment
of the Microservices and the authentication service, the problem would be
solved.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-unreliable-communication" class="calibre15">Unreliable Communication</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Communication between Microservices occurs via the network and is therefore
unreliable. In addition, Microservices can fail. To prevent that a
failure of the entire system ensues, the remaining Microservices in
such a case have to compensate for the failure of the malfunctioning
Microservice and keep being available. However, to achieve this goal
the quality of the services has to be degraded i.e. by using default
values or limiting the useable functionality
(<a href="part0014.html#section10-5">section 10.5</a>).</p>

<p class="calibre3">This problem cannot be completely solved on a technical level: The
Microservice availability can for instance be optimized by highly
available hardware. But this increases costs. Besides, it is no
complete solution: In some respects, it even increases risk. If the
Microservice fails despite highly available hardware and the failure
propagates across the entire system, a complete failure of the entire
system occurs. Thus, the Microservices should rather compensate the
failure of another Microservice.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In addition, the threshold between a technical and a domain problem is
crossed. An ATM might serve as example: When the ATM cannot retrieve
the account balance of the customer, there are two possibilities. The
ATM can refuse the withdrawal. Although this is a safe option, it will
anger the customer and decrease revenue. Alternatively, the ATM can hand
out the money – maybe up to a certain upper limit. Which alternative
should be implemented, is a business decision. Eventually, somebody has
to decide whether it is preferable to be on the safe side, even if it
means to forego some revenue and anger customers, or to run a certain
risk to pay out too much money.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-technology-pluralism" class="calibre15">Technology Pluralism</h5>

<p class="calibre3">The technology freedom of Microservices can result in a project using
many different technologies. The Microservices do not need to have a
shared technology basis. Accordingly, the complexity of the whole
system increases. Each team masters the technologies, which are used
in its own Microservice. However, the large number of used
technologies and approaches can cause the system as such to reach a
level of complexity no individual developer or team can understand
anymore. But often such a general understanding is not necessary since
each team only needs to understand its own Microservice. Whenever it
becomes necessary to have a look at the entire system - be it even
only from a certain limited perspective as for instance operations –,
the complexity might pose a problem. In such cases, unification can be a
sensible counter measure. This does not mean that the technology stack
has to be completely uniform, but that certain parts should be uniform
or that the individual Microservices should behave in a uniform
manner. For instance, a uniform logging framework might be defined or
a uniform format for logging, which different logging frameworks
might implement differently. Alternatively, a common technical
basis like the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) can be decided upon for
operational reasons without setting the programming languages.</p>

<h3 id="section6-2" class="calibre2">6.2 Architecture</h3>

<p class="calibre3">The architecture of a Microservice-based system distributes the
domain-based functionalities among the Microservices. To understand the
architecture at this level dependencies and communication
relationships between the Microservices have to be known. Analyzing
communication relationships is difficult. For large Deployment
Monoliths there are tools, which read source code or even only the
executable system. Based on this the tools can generate graphs
visualizing modules and relationships. This makes it possible to
verify the implemented architecture, adjust it in regards to the
planned architecture and to follow the architecture evolution over
time. Such overviews are central for architectural work, however,
difficult to generate in the case of Microservices as the respective
tools are lacking – but there are solutions. <a href="part0012.html#section8-2">Section 8.2</a>
discusses these in detail.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-architecture--organization" class="calibre15">Architecture = Organization</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Microservices are based on the idea that organization and architecture
are the same. Microservices exploit this circumstance to implement the
architecture. The organization is structured in a way, which renders
the architecture implementation especially easy. However, this means
that an architecture refactoring can entail changes to the
organization. This renders architectural changes more difficult. This
is not only a problem of Microservices: Conway’s Law
(<a href="part0007.html#section4-2">section 4.2</a>) applies to all projects. However, other
projects often are not aware of the law and its implications.
Therefore, they do not use the law productively and cannot estimate the
organizational problems caused by architectural changes.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-architecture-and-requirements" class="calibre15">Architecture and Requirements</h5>

<p class="calibre3">The architecture influences also the independent development of
individual Microservices and the independent streams of stories. When
the domain-based distribution of Microservices is not optimal,
requirements might not only influence one team and one Microservice,
but several. In such cases a larger amount of coordination is
necessary between the different teams and Microservices. This
influences the productivity negatively and thus undoes one of the
essential reasons for the introduction of Microservices.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In case of Microservices the architecture influences not only the
software quality, but also the organization and the independent work
of the teams and thereby the productivity. Designing an optimal
architecture gets even more important since mistakes have far reaching
consequences.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Many projects do not pay sufficient attention to domain architecture,
often much less than to technical architecture. Besides, most
architects are not as experienced with domain architecture as with
technical architecture. These circumstances can cause tremendous
problems in the case of Microservice-based approaches. The
distribution into Microservices and therefore into fields of
responsibility for the different teams has to be performed according
to domain criteria.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-refactoring-1" class="calibre15">Refactoring</h5>

<p class="calibre3">In a single Microservice refactoring is simple since the Microservice is
small. It can also be easily replaced and newly implemented.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Between Microservices the situation differs: Transferring
functionalities from one Microservice to another is difficult. The
functionality has to be moved into a different deployment unit. This
is for sure more difficult than moving a functionality within the same
unit. Between Microservices technologies are not necessarily uniform.
Microservices can use different libraries or even different
programming languages. In such cases the functionality has to be moved
into a new Microservice. In some cases the functionality must be newly
implemented in the technology of the other Microservice and
subsequently transferred into this Microservice. However, this is far
more complex than moving code within a Microservice.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-agile-architecture" class="calibre15">Agile Architecture</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Microservices make it easier to bring as many changes as possible into
production in the shortest possible time and to reach a sustainable
development speed. This is especially advantageous when there are
numerous and hard to predict requirements. This is exactly the
environment where Microservices are at home. Changes to a Microservice
are also very simple. However, adjusting the architecture of the
system as such, for instance by moving around functionalities, is not
so simple.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In addition, the architecture of a system is frequently not yet
optimal at the first attempt. During implementation the team learns a
lot about the domain. In a second attempt, it will be much more
capable of designing an appropriate architecture. Most projects
suffering from bad architecture had a good architecture at the outset
based on the state of knowledge at that time. However, when the
project progressed, it became clear that requirements were meant
differently and new requirements arose so that the initial
architecture stopped fitting. Problems arise when this does not lead
to consequences. If the project just continues with a more and more
inappropriate architecture, the architecture will not fit at all
anymore at some point. This can be avoided by adjusting the
architecture step by step to the changed requirements based on the
respective state of knowledge. Architecture changeability and
architecture adjustment in line with new requirements are central for
this. However, architecture changeability at the level of the entire
system is a weakness of Microservices while changes within
Microservices are very simple.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-summary-1" class="calibre15">Summary</h5>

<p class="calibre3">When using Microservices, architecture is even more important than in
other systems as it influences also the organization and the
independent work on requirements. At the same time, Microservices
offer many advantages in cases where requirements are unclear and
architecture therefore has to be changeable. Unfortunately, the
interplay between Microservices is hard to modify since the
distribution into Microservices is quite rigid due to the distributed
communication between them. Besides, as Microservices can be
implemented by the use of different technologies, it gets difficult to
move functionalities around. On the other hand, changes to individual
Microservices or their replacement are very simple.</p>

<h3 id="section6-3" class="calibre2">6.3 Infrastructure and Operations</h3>

<p class="calibre3">Microservices are supposed to be brought into production independently
of each other and to be able to use individual technology stacks.
Therefore, each Microservice usually resides on its own server. This
is the only way to ensure complete technological independence. It is
not possible to cope with the required multitude of systems using
hardware servers. Even with virtualization the management of such an
environment remains difficult. The number of required virtual machines
can be higher than otherwise used by an entire business IT. When there
are hundreds of Microservices, there are also hundreds of virtual
machines needed and for some of them several instances e.g. for load
balancing. This requires automation and appropriate infrastructures,
which are able to generate a large number of virtual machines.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-continuous-delivery-pipelines" class="calibre15">Continuous Delivery Pipelines</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Beyond operation each Microservice requires additional infrastructure:
It needs its own Continuous Delivery pipeline so that it can be
brought into production independently of the other Microservices. This
means that appropriate test environments and automation scripts are
necessary. The large number of pipelines causes additional challenges:
The pipelines have to be built up and maintained. Furthermore, to
reduce expenses they need to be largely standardized.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-monitoring" class="calibre15">Monitoring</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Each Microservice requires in addition monitoring. This is the only
way to recognize problems with the service at runtime. In case of a
Deployment Monolith, it is still quite easy to monitor the system.
When problems arise, the administrator can log into the system and use
specific tools to analyze errors. Microservice-based systems contain
so many systems that this approach is not feasible anymore.
Consequently, there has to be a monitoring, which comprises all
systems. Thereby, not only the typical information from the operating
system and the I/O to the hard disc and to the network should be
analyzed, also a view into the application should be possible based
on application metrics. This is the only way for developers to find
out where the application has to be optimized and where problems exist
at the moment.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-version-control" class="calibre15">Version control</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Finally, every Microservice has to be stored under version control
independent of the other ones. Only software, which is separately
versioned, can be brought into production individually. When two
software modules are versioned together, they should always be brought
into production together. Otherwise a change might have influenced
both modules so that in fact both services should be newly delivered.
Moreover, if an old version of one of the services is in
production, it is not clear whether an update is necessary or whether
the new version does not contain changes – after all the new version
might only have contained changes in the other Microservice.</p>

<p class="calibre3">For Deployment Monoliths a lower number of servers, environments and projects in
version control would be necessary. This decreases complexity. The
requirements in regards to operation and infrastructure are much
higher in a Microservices environment. To deal with this complexity is
the biggest challenge when introducing Microservices.</p>

<h3 id="section6-4" class="calibre2">6.4 Conclusion</h3>

<p class="calibre3">This chapter discussed the different challenges associated with
Microservices-based approaches. At the technical level
(<a href="part0009.html#section6-1">section 6.1</a>) the challenges are mostly a consequence of
the fact that Microservices are distributed systems: Due to that,
system performance and reliability are more difficult to ensure. In
addition, technical complexity increases because of the greater
variety of used technologies. Furthermore, code dependencies can
render the independent deployment of Microservices impossible.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The architecture of a Microservice-based system
(<a href="part0009.html#section6-2">section 6.2</a>) is extremely important due to its impact
on the organization and the parallel implementation of multiple
stories. At the same time, changes to the interplay of Microservices
are hard. Functionalities cannot be easily transferred from one
Microservice to another. Classes within a project can often even be
moved automatically. Between Microservices manual work is necessary.
The interface to the code changes from local calls to communication
between Microservices. This increases the necessary efforts. Finally,
Microservices can be written in different programming languages – in
such cases to move code entails that it has to be rewritten.</p>

<p class="calibre3">However, changes to system architecture are often necessary because of
unclear requirements. Besides, the team permanently improves its
knowledge about the system and its domain. Especially in circumstances
where the use of Microservices is particularly advantageous because of
rapid and independent deployments, architecture should be peculiarly
easy to change. Within Microservices changes are indeed easy to
implement, however between Microservices they are very laborious.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Finally infrastructure complexity rises due to the larger number of
services (<a href="part0009.html#section6-3">section 6.3</a>) since more servers, more
projects in version control and more Continuous Delivery pipelines are
necessary. This is a central challenge encountered by
Microservice-based architectures.</p>

<p class="calibre3"><a href="part0011.html#part-III">Part III</a> of the book is going to show solutions for these challenges.</p>
