<h2 id="part-III" class="calibre1">Part III: Implementing Microservices</h2>

<p class="calibre3">This part of the book demonstrates how Microservices can be
implemented. After studying this part the reader cannot only design
Microservice-based architectures, but also implement them and evaluate
the organizational effects.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-chapter-8-architecture-of-microservice-based-systems" class="calibre15">Chapter 8: Architecture of Microservice-based Systems</h5>

<p class="calibre3"><a href="part0012.html#chapter-8">Chapter 8</a> describes the architecture of
Microservice-based systems. It focuses on the interplay between
individual Microservices.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The domain architecture deals with Domain-Driven Design as basis of
Microservice-based architectures and shows metrics which allow to
measure the quality of the architecture. Architecture management
is a challenge: It can be difficult to keep the overview of the
numerous Microservices. However, often it is sufficient to understand
how a certain use case is implemented and which Microservices interact
in a specific scenario.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Practically all IT systems are subject to more or less profound
change. Therefore the architecture of a Microservice system has to
evolve and the system has to undergo continued development. To achieve
this several challenges have to be solved, which do not arise in this
form in the case of Deployment Monoliths – for instance the overall
distribution into Microservices is difficult to change. However,
changes to individual Microservices are simple.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In addition, Microservice systems need to integrate legacy systems.
This is quite simple as Microservices can treat legacy systems as
blackbox. A replacement of a Deployment Monolith by Microservices can
progressively transfer more functionalities into Microservices without
having to adjust the inner structure of the legacy system or having to
understand the code in detail.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The technical architecture comprises typical challenges for the
implementation of Microservices. In most cases there is a central
configuration and coordination for all Microservices. Furthermore, a
load balancer distributes the load between the individual instances of
the Microservices. The security architecture has to leave each
Microservice the freedom to implement its own authorizations in the
system, but also ensure that a user needs to log in only once.
Finally, Microservices should return information concerning themselves
as documentation and as metadata.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-chapter-9-integration-and-communication" class="calibre15">Chapter 9: Integration and Communication</h5>

<p class="calibre3"><a href="part0013.html#chapter-9">Chapter 9</a> shows the different possibilities for the integration and
communication between Microservices. There are three possible levels
for integration:</p>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">Microservices can integrate at the web level. In that case each
Microservice delivers a part of the web UI.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">At the logic level Microservices can communicate via REST or
messaging.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Data replication is also possible.</li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre3">Via these technologies the Microservices have internal interfaces for
other Microservices. The complete system can have one interface to the
outside. Changes to the different interfaces create different
challenges. Accordingly, this chapter also deals with versioning of
interfaces and the effects thereof.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-chapter-10-architecture-of-individual-microservices" class="calibre15">Chapter 10: Architecture of Individual Microservices</h5>

<p class="calibre3"><a href="part0014.html#chapter-10">Chapter 10</a> describes possibilities for the architecture
of an individual Microservice. There
are different approaches for an individual Microservice:</p>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">CQRS divides read and write access into two separate services. This
allows for smaller services and an independent scaling of both parts.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Event Sourcing administrates the state of a Microservice via a
stream of events from which the current state can be deduced.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">In a hexagonal architecture the Microservice possesses a core,
which can be accessed via different adaptors and which communicates
also via such adaptors with other Microservices or the infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre3">Each Microservice can follow an independent architecture.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In the end all Microservices have to handle technical challenges like
resilience and stability – these issues have to be solved by their
technical architecture.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-chapter-11-testing-microservices-and-microservice-based-systems" class="calibre15">Chapter 11: Testing Microservices and Microservice-based Systems</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Testing is the focus of <a href="part0015.html#chapter-11">chapter 11</a>. Also tests have to
take the special challenges associated with Microservices into
consideration.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The chapter starts off with explaining why tests are necessary at all
and how a system can be tested in principle.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Microservices are small deployment units. This decreases the risk
associated with deployments. Accordingly, besides tests also
optimization of deployment can help to decrease the risk.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Testing the entire system represents a special problem in case of
Microservices since only one Microservice at a time can pass through
this phase. If the tests last one hour, only eight deployments will be
feasible per working day. In the case of 50 Microservices that is by
far too few. Therefore, it is necessary to limit these tests as much
as possible.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Often Microservices replace legacy systems. The Microservices and the
legacy system both have to be tested – and also their interplay. Tests
for the individual Microservices differ in some respects greatly from
tests for other software systems.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Consumer-driven contract tests are an essential component of
Microservice tests: They test the expectations of a Microservice in
regards to an interface. Thereby the correct interplay of
Microservices can be ensured without having to test the Microservices
together in an integration test. Instead a Microservice defines its
requirements for the interface in a test, which the used Microservice
can execute.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Microservices have to adhere to certain standards in regards to
monitoring or logging. The adherence to these standards can also be
checked by tests.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-chapter-12-operation-and-continuous-delivery-of-microservices" class="calibre15">Chapter 12: Operation and Continuous Delivery of Microservices</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Operation and Continuous Delivery are the focus of
<a href="part0016.html#chapter-12">chapter 12</a>. Especially the infrastructure is an
essential challenge when introducing Microservices. Logging and
monitoring have to be uniformly implemented across all Microservices,
otherwise the associated expenditure gets too large. In addition,
there should be a uniform deployment. Finally, starting and stopping
of Microservices should be possible in a uniform manner – i.e. via a
simple control. For these areas the chapter introduces concrete
technologies and approaches. Additionally, the chapter presents
infrastructures which especially facilitate the operation of a
Microservices environment.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-chapter-13-organizational-effects-of-a-microservice-based-architecture" class="calibre15">Chapter 13: Organizational Effects of a Microservice-based Architecture</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Finally <a href="part0017.html#chapter-13">chapter 13</a> discusses how Microservices
influence the organization. Microservices allow for a simpler
distribution of tasks to independent teams and thus for parallel work
on different features. To that end the tasks have to be distributed to
the teams, which subsequently introduce the appropriate changes into
their Microservices. However, new features can also comprise several
Microservices. In that case one team has to put requirements to
another team – this requires a lot of coordination and delays the
implementation of new features. Therefore, it can be better that teams
also change Microservices of other teams.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Microservices divide the architecture into micro and
macro architecture: In regards to micro architecture the teams can
make their own decisions while the macro architecture has to be
defined for and coordinated across all Microservices. In areas like
operation, architecture and testing individual aspects can be assigned to
micro or macro architecture.</p>

<p class="calibre3">DevOps as organizational form fits well to Microservices since close
cooperation between operation and development is very useful,
especially for the infrastructure intensive Microservices.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The independent teams each need their own independent requirements,
which in the end have to be derived from the domain. Consequently,
Microservices have also effects in these areas.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Code recycling is likewise an organizational problem: How do the teams
coordinate the different requirements for shared components? A model
which is inspired by open source projects can help.</p>

<p class="calibre3">However, there is of course the question whether Microservices are
possible at all without organizational changes – after all, the
independent teams constitute one of the essential reasons for
introducing Microservices.</p>
