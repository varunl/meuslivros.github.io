<h3 id="section2-1" class="calibre2">2.1 Overview of the Book</h3>

<p class="calibre3">This book provides a detailed introduction to Microservices.
Architecture and organization are the main topics. However, technical
implementation strategies will not be neglected. A complete example of
a Microservice-based system demonstrates a concrete technical
implementation. Technologies for Nanoservices illustrates that
modularization does not stop with Microservices. The book provides all
necessary information in order to enable readers to start using
Microservices.</p>

<h3 id="section2-2" class="calibre2">2.2 For Whom is the Book Meant?</h3>

<p class="calibre3">The book addresses managers, architects and developers who want to
introduce Microservices as an architectural approach.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-managers" class="calibre15">Managers</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Microservices can profit from the mutual support of architecture and
organization Microservices offer. In the introduction managers get to
know the basic ideas behind Microservices. Afterwards they can focus
on the organizational effects of utilizing Microservices.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-developers" class="calibre15">Developers</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Developers are provided with a comprehensive introduction to the
technical aspects and can acquire the necessary skills to use
Microservices. A detailed example of a technical implementation of
Microservices as well as numerous additional technologies, for example
for Nanoservices, facilitate grasping the basic concepts.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-architects" class="calibre15">Architects</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Architects get to know Microservices from an architecture perspective
and can at the same time deepen their understanding of the associated
technical and organizational issues.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The book highlights possibilities for experiments and additional
information sources. So the interested reader can test her/his new
knowledge practically and delve deeper into subjects that are of
relevance to her/him.</p>

<h3 id="section2-3" class="calibre2">2.3 Chapter Overview</h3>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-part-i" class="calibre15">Part I</h5>

<p class="calibre3">The first part of the book explains the motivation for using
Microservices and the foundation of the Microservices
architecture. The preface (<a href="part0002.html#chapter-1">chapter 1</a>) already presented
the basic properties as well as advantages and disadvantages of
Microservices. <a href="part0005.html#chapter-3">Chapter 3</a> presents two scenarios for the use of Microservices: an E-Commerce application and a system for signal processing. This part conveys first insights into Microservices and already points out contexts for applications.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-part-ii" class="calibre15">Part II</h5>

<p class="calibre3"><a href="part0006.html#part-II">Part II</a> does not only explain Microservices in detail, but also deals with their advantages and disadvantages:</p>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">
<a href="part0007.html#chapter-4">Chapter4</a> investigates the <strong class="calibre19">definition</strong> of the term Microservices” from three perspectives: the size of a Microservice, Conway’s Law, which states that organizations can only create specific software architectures, and finally from a technical perspective based on Domain-Driven Design and <em class="calibre20">Bounded Context</em>.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">The <strong class="calibre19">reasons</strong> for using Microservices are detailed in <a href="part0008.html#chapter-5">chapter 5</a>. Microservices do not only have technical, but also organizational advantages, and also from a business perspective there are good reasons for turning to Microservices.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">The unique <strong class="calibre19">challenges</strong> posed by Microservices are discussed in <a href="part0009.html#chapter-6">chapter 6</a>. Among these are technical challenges as well as problems related to architecture, infrastructure and operation.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">
<a href="part0010.html#chapter-7">Chapter 7</a> aims at defining the differences between Microservices and <strong class="calibre19">SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)</strong>. At first sight both concepts seem to be closely related. However, a closer look reveals a plethora of differences.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-part-iii" class="calibre15">Part III</h5>

<p class="calibre3"><a href="part0011.html#part-III">Part III</a> deals with the application of Microservices and
demonstrates how the advantages that were described in <a href="part0006.html#part-II">part II</a> can be obtained and how the associated challenges can be solved.</p>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">
<a href="part0012.html#chapter-8">Chapter 8</a> describes the <strong class="calibre19">architecture of
Microservice-based systems</strong>. In addition to domain architecture comprehensive technical challenges are discussed.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">
<a href="part0013.html#chapter-9">Chapter 9</a> presents the different possibilities for the
<strong class="calibre19">integration</strong> of and the <strong class="calibre19">communication</strong> between
Microservices. This includes not only a communication via REST or
messaging, but also an integration of UIs and the replication of data.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">
<a href="part0014.html#chapter-10">Chapter 10</a> shows possible <strong class="calibre19">architectures for Microservices</strong> such as CQRS, Event Sourcing or hexagonal architecture. Finally suitable technologies for typical challenges are addressed.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">
<strong class="calibre19">Testing</strong> is the main focus of <a href="part0015.html#chapter-11">chapter 11</a>. Tests have to be as independent as possible to allow for the independent deployment of the different Microservices. Nevertheless the tests have not only to check the individual Microservices, but also the system in its entirety.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Operation and <strong class="calibre19">Continuous Delivery</strong> are addressed in
<a href="part0016.html#chapter-12">chapter 12</a>. Microservices generate a huge number of deployable artefacts and thus increase the demands on the infrastructure. This is a substantial challenge when introducing Microservices.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">
<a href="part0017.html#chapter-13">Chapter 13</a> illustrates how Microservices also influence the <strong class="calibre19">organization</strong>. After all, Microservices are an architecture, which is supposed to influence and improve the organization.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-part-iv" class="calibre15">Part IV</h5>

<p class="calibre3">The last <a href="part0018.html#part-IV">part of the book</a> shows in detail and at the code level how Microservices can be technically implemented:</p>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">
<a href="part0019.html#chapter-14">Chapter 14</a> contains an exhaustive example for a Microservices architecture based on Java, Spring Boot, Docker and Spring Cloud. This chapter aims at providing an application, which can be easily run, illustrates the concepts behind Microservices in practical terms and offers a starting point for the implementation of a Microservices system and experiments.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Even smaller than Microservices are the Nanoservices, which are
presented in <a href="part0020.html#chapter-15">chapter 15</a>. Nanoservices exact specific technologies and a number of compromises. The chapter discusses different technologies in the context of their advantages and disadvantages. </li>
  <li class="calibre14">
<a href="part0021.html#chapter-16">Chapter 16</a> demonstrates in the end how Microservices can be adopted.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="section2-4" class="calibre2">2.4 Essays</h3>

<p class="calibre3">The book contains assays, which were written by Microservices experts. The experts were asked to record their main findings regarding Microservices on approximately two pages. Sometimes these assays complement book chapters, sometimes they focus on other topics, and sometimes they contradict passages in the book. This illustrates that there is in general no single right answer when it comes to software architectures, but rather a collection of different opinions and possibilities. The essays offer the unique opportunity to get to know different view points in order to subsequently develop an opinion.</p>

<h3 id="section2-5" class="calibre2">2.5 Paths Through the Book</h3>

<p class="calibre3">The book offers suitable content (<a href="part0004.html#tab-1">Tab. 1</a>) for each type of audience. Of course, everybody can and should read also chapters that are primarily meant for people with a different type of job.  Nevertheless the chapters are focussing on topics that are most relevant for a certain audience as indicated below.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Readers who only want to obtain an overview are advised to concentrate on the summary section at the end of each chapter. People who want to gain first of all practical knowledge should commence with <a href="part0019.html#chapter-14">chapters 14</a> and <a href="part0020.html#chapter-15">15</a>, which deal with concrete technologies and code.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The instructions for experiments, which are given in the sections “Try and Experiment”, help to deepen the understanding by doing practical exercises. Whenever a chapter is of particular interest for the reader, he/she is encouraged to complete the related exercises to get a better grasp on the topics presented in the respective chapter.</p>
