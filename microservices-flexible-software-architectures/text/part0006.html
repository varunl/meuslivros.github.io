<p class="calibre3">This part of the book discusses the different facettes of
Microservice-based architectures to present the diverse
possibilities offered by Microservices. Advantages as well as
disadvantages are addressed so that the reader can evaluate what can
be gained by using Microservices and which points require special
attention and care during the implementation of Microservice-based
architectures.</p>

<p class="calibre3"><a href="part0007.html#chapter-4">Chapter 4</a> explains the term “Microservice” in detail.
The term is dissected from different perspectives, which is essential
for an in depth understanding of the Microservice approach. Important
aspects are the size of a Microservice, Conway’s Law as organizational
influence and Domain-Driven Design resp. <em class="calibre20">Bounded Context</em> from a
domain perspective. Furthermore, the chapter addresses the question
whether a Microservice should contain a UI. <a href="part0008.html#chapter-5">Chapter 5</a>
focuses on the advantages of Microservices taking alternatingly a technical,
organizational and business perspective.
<a href="part0009.html#chapter-6">Chapter 6</a> deals with the associated challenges in the
areas of technology, architecture, infrastructure and operation.
<a href="part0010.html#chapter-7">Chapter 7</a> distinguishes Microservices from SOA
(Service-Oriented Architecture). By making this distinction
Microservices are viewed from a new perspective which helps to further
clarify the Microservices approach. Besides Microservices have been
frequently compared to SOAs.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Afterwards the third part of the book will introduce how Microservices
can be implemented in practice.</p>
