<h2 id="chapter-3" class="calibre1">3 Microservice Scenarios</h2>

<p class="calibre3">This chapter will present a number of scenarios in which 
Microservices can be useful. <a href="part0005.html#section3-1">Section 3.1</a> focuses on the
modernization of a legacy web application. This scenario is the most
common context for Microservices. A very different
scenario is discussed in <a href="part0005.html#section3-2">section 3.2</a>. In this case a
signaling system is supposed to be developed as distributed system
based on Microservices. <a href="part0005.html#section3-3">Section 3.3</a> formulates a
conclusion and invites the readers to judge for themselves on the
usefulness of Microservices in the presented scenarios.</p>

<h3 id="section3-1" class="calibre2">3.1 Modernizing an E-Commerce Legacy Application</h3>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-scenario" class="calibre15">Scenario</h5>

<p class="calibre3">The Big Money Online Commerce inc. runs an E-commerce shop, which is the
main source of the company revenue. It is a web application
offering many different functionalities such as user registration and
administration, product search, an overview of orders and the
ordering process – the central feature of an E-commerce application.</p>

<p class="calibre3">This application is a Deployment Monolith: It can only be deployed in
its entirety.  Whenever a feature is changed, the entire application
needs to be deployed anew. The E-Commerce shop works together with
other systems – for instance with accounting and logistics.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-reasons-to-use-microservices" class="calibre15">Reasons to Use Microservices</h5>

<p class="calibre3">The Deployment Monolith once started out as a well-structured
application. However, over the years more and more dependencies
between the individual modules creeped in. For this reason the
application is nowadays hardly maintainable and changeable. In
addition the original architecture is not suited any more for the
current requirements. Product search for instance has been greatly modified
as the Big Money Online Commerce inc. attempts to outperform its
competitors especially in this area. Likewise more and more
possibilities have been generated for clients to solve problems by
themselves without the assistance of a client service. This helped the
company to reduce costs. Accordingly, these two modules became
very large with a very complex internal structure and many
dependencies on other modules that had not been planned for
originally.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-slow-continuous-delivery-pipeline" class="calibre15">Slow Continuous Delivery Pipeline</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Big Money has decided to use Continuous Delivery and has established a
Continuous Delivery pipeline. This pipeline is complicated and slow
as the complete Deployment Monolith needs to be
tested and brought into production. Some of the tests run for hours.
A faster pipeline would be highly desirable.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-parallel-work-complicated" class="calibre15">Parallel Work Complicated</h5>

<p class="calibre3">There are teams working on different new features. However, the
parallel work is complicated: The software structure just doesn’t
really support it.
The individual modules are not well enough separated and have
too many interdependencies. As everything can only be deployed
together, the entire Deployment Monolith has to be tested. Deployment
and testing phase constitute a bottle neck. Whenever a team is having
a release in the deployment pipeline, which is creating a problem, all
other teams have to wait until the problem has been fixed and the change has been successfully
deployed. Moreover, the access to the Continuous Delivery pipeline has
to be coordinated. Only one team at a time can be doing testing and
deployment. Thus it has to be regulated which team can bring which
change into production at which time.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-bottleneck-during-testing" class="calibre15">Bottleneck During Testing</h5>

<p class="calibre3">In addition to deployment also the tests have to be coordinated. When
the Deployment Monolith runs in an integration test, only the changes
made by one team are allowed to be contained in the test. There were
attempts to test several changes at once. However, in that case it was
very hard to discern the origin of errors so that error analyses were
long and complex.</p>

<p class="calibre3">One integration test requires approximately one hour. Thus about six
integration tests are feasible per working day as errors have to be
fixed and the environment has to be set up again for the next test.
In the case of ten
teams one team can bring one change into production every two days on
average. However, often a team also has to do error analysis, which
lengthens integration. For that reason some teams use feature branches in
order to separate themselves from integration: They perform their
changes on a separate branch in the version control system. Integrating these
changes into the main branch later on often causes problems: Changes
are erroneously removed again upon merging or the software suddenly
contains errors, which are caused by the separated development
process and only show up after integration. These errors can only be eliminated in lengthy processes
after integration.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Consequently, the teams slow each other down due to the testing.
Although each team develops its own modules, they all work on the same
code basis so that they impede each other. As a consequence of the
shared Continuous Delivery pipeline and the ensuing need for
coordination the teams are neither able to work independently of each
other nor in parallel.</p>

  <figcaption class="calibre18">Fig. 2: Teams slow each other down due to the Deployment Monoliths.</figcaption>
</figure>


<h5 id="leanpub-auto-approach" class="calibre15">Approach</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Because of the many problems Big Money Online Commerce inc.
decided to split off small Microservices from the Deployment Monolith.
The Microservices each implement one feature such as the product
search and are developed by individual teams. Each team has the
complete responsibility for an individual Microservice starting from
requirements engineering up to running the application in production. The Microservices
communicate with the Monolith and other Microservices via REST. The
client GUI is also divided between the individual Microservices
based on use cases. Each Microservice delivers the HTML pages for its
use cases. Links are allowed between the HTML pages of the
Microservices. However, it is not allowed to access the database
tables of the other Microservices or the Deployment Monolith. Integration
of services is exclusively done via REST or via links
between the HTML pages.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The Microservices can be deployed independently of each other. This
allows to deliver changes in a Microservice without the need to
coordinate with other Microservices or teams. This greatly facilitates
parallel work on features while reducing coordination efforts.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The Deployment Monolith is subject to far fewer changes due to the
addition of Microservices. For many features changes to the
Monolith are not necessary anymore. Thus, the Deployment Monolith is
more seldom deployed and changed. Originally, it was planned to
completely replace the Deployment Monolith at some point. However,
meanwhile it seems more likely that the Deployment Monolith will just
be deployed less and less frequently as most changes take place within
the Microservices. Thus the Deployment Monolith does not disturb work
any more. To replace it entirely is in the end not necessary and also
does not appear sensible in economic terms anymore.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-challenges-1" class="calibre15">Challenges</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Implementing Microservices creates additional complexity in the
beginning: All the Microservices need their own infrastructure. In
parallel the Monolith has still to be supported.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The Microservices comprise a lot more servers and thus pose very
different challenges. Monitoring and log file processing have to deal
with the fact that the data originate from different servers. Thus
information has to be centrally consolidated. Besides a substantially
larger number of servers has to be handled – not only in production,
but also in the different test stages and team environments. This
is only possible with good infrastructure
automatization. It is not only necessary to support different types of
infrastructure for the Monolith and the Microservices, but also to
provide substantially more servers in the end.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-entire-migration-lengthy" class="calibre15">Entire Migration Lengthy</h5>

<p class="calibre3">The added complexity due to the two different software types will
persist for a long time as it is a very lengthy process to completely
migrate away from the Monolith. If the Monolith is never entirely
replaced, the additional infrastructure costs will remain as well.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-testing-remains-a-challenge" class="calibre15">Testing Remains a Challenge.</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Testing is an additional challenge: Previously the entire Deployment
Monolith was tested in the deployment pipeline. These tests are
complex and take a long time as all functionalities of the Deployment
Monolith have to be tested. If each change to each Microservice is
sent through these tests, it will take a long time for each change to
reach production. Moreover, the changes have to be coordinated as each
change should be tested in isolation so that it is easily discernible
in case of errors which change caused them. In that scenario a
Microservices-based architecture does not seem to have major
advantages over a Deployment Monolith: While Microservices can in principle be
deployed independently of each other, the test stages preceding
deployment still have to be coordinated and each change
still has to pass through them singly.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-current-status-of-migration" class="calibre15">Current Status of Migration</h5>

<p class="calibre3"><a href="part0005.html#Fig3">Fig. 3</a> presents the current status: Product search works on
an independent Microservice and is completely independent of the
Deployment Monolith. Coordination with other teams is hardly
necessary. Only in the last stage of the deployment the Deployment
Monolith and the Microservices have to be tested together. Each change
to the Monolith or any Microservice has to run through this step. This
causes a bottleneck. The team “Customer” works together with the team
“Order Process” on the Deployment Monolith. In spite of Microservices
these teams still have to closely coordinate their work. For that
reason the team “Order Process” has implemented its own Microservice,
which comprises part of the order process. In this part of the system
changes can be introduced faster than in the Deployment Monolith - not
only due to the younger code basis, but also because it is no longer
necessary to coordinate with the other teams.</p>


<figure id="Fig3" class="image">
  <img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="Fig. 3: Independent work through Microservices" class="calibre17"/>
  <figcaption class="calibre18">Fig. 3: Independent work through Microservices</figcaption>
</figure>


<h5 id="leanpub-auto-creating-teams" class="calibre15">Creating Teams</h5>

<p class="calibre3">For the teams to be able to work independently on features it is
important to create teams according to functionalities such as product search,
customer or order process. If teams are instead created along technical
layers such as UI, Middle Tier or database, each feature requires the
involvement of all the teams as a feature normally comprises changes to
UI, Middle Tier and database. Thus to minimize coordination efforts
between the teams, the best approach is to create teams around
features like product search. Microservices support the independence
of the teams by their own technical independence from each other.
Consequently, teams need to coordinate less in respect to basic
technologies and technical designs.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The tests have also to be modularized. Each test should ideally deal
with a single Microservice. In that case it is sufficient
to perform the test upon changes in the respective Microservice. In
addition it might be possible to implement the test
rather as unit test than as integration test. This progressively
shortens the test phase in which all Microservices and the Monolith
have to be tested together. This reduces the coordination problems for
the final test phase.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Migrating to a Microservices-based architecture created a number of
performance problems and also some problems upon network failures.
However, these problems could be solved after some time.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-advantages" class="calibre15">Advantages</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Thanks to the new architecture changes can be deployed much faster. A
team can bring a change into production within 30 minutes. The
Deployment Monolith on the other hand is deployed only weekly due to
the not yet fully automated tests.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Deploying the Microservices is not only much faster, but also in other
respects much more comfortable: Less coordination is required. Errors
are more easily found and fixed because developers still know very
well what they have been working on as it was only 30 minutes ago.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In summary the goal was attained: The developers can introduce more
changes to the  E-Commerce shop. This is possible because the teams
need to coordinate their work less and because the deployment of a
Microservice can take place independently of the other services.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The possibility to use different technologies was sparingly used by
the teams: The previously used technology stack proved sufficient, and
the teams wanted to avoid the additional complexity caused by the use
of different technologies. However, the long needed search engine for
the product search was introduced. The team responsible for product
search was able to implement this change on its own. Previously the
introduction of this new technology had been prohibited because the associated risk had been considered too great. In
addition some teams meanwhile have new versions of the libraries of
the technology stack in production as they needed the bug fixes of the
more recent version. This
did not require any coordination with the other teams.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-conclusion" class="calibre15">Conclusion</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Replacing a Monolith via the implementation of Microservices is
nearly a classical scenario for the introduction of Microservices. It
requires a lot of effort to keep developing a Monolith and to add new
features to it. The complexity of the Monolith and consequently the
problems caused by it progressively increase over time. Its complete
replacement by a newly written system is very difficult. The software has
to be replaced in one go which is very risky.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-rapid-and-independent-development-of-new-features" class="calibre15">Rapid and Independent Development of new Features</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Especially in the case of companies like Big Money Online Commerce
inc. the rapid development of new features and the parallel work on
several features are vital for economic success. Only by providing state of
the art features customers can be won and kept from changing to other
companies. The promise to develop more features faster renders
Microservices highly attractive for many use cases.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-influence-on-the-organization" class="calibre15">Influence on the Organization</h5>

<p class="calibre3">The presented example illustrates also the influence of Microservices
on the organization. The teams work on their own Microservices. As the
Microservices can be developed and deployed independently of each
other, the work of the different teams is no longer linked. In order
to keep it that way a Microservice may not be changed by several
teams in parallel. The Microservices architecture requires a team
organization corresponding to the different Microservices: Each team
is responsible for one or several Microservices, which implement an
isolated functionality. This relationship between organization and
architecture is especially important in the case of
Microservices-based architectures. Each team takes care of all issues
revolving around “its” Microservices from requirements engineering up to
operation monitoring. Of course, especially for operation the teams
can use common infrastructure services for logging and monitoring.</p>

<p class="calibre3">And finally: If the goal is to achieve a simple and fast deployment in
production, just including Microservices into the architecture will
not be sufficient. The entire Continuous Delivery pipeline has to be
checked for potential obstacles and these have to be removed. This is
illustrated by the tests in the presented example: Testing all
Microservices together should be reduced to the essential minimum. Each
change has to run through an integration test together with the other
Microservices, but this test must not require a lot of time to avoid
a bottleneck in integration tests.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-amazon-has-been-doing-it-for-a-long-time" class="calibre15">Amazon Has Been Doing It for a Long Time</h5>

<p class="calibre3">The scenario presented here is very similar to what Amazon
has been doing already for a very long time – and for the discussed
reasons: Amazon wants to be able to rapidly and easily implement new
features on its website. In 2006 Amazon did not only present its Cloud
platform, but also discussed how it develops software. Essential
features are:</p>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">The application is divided into different services.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Each services provides a part of the website. For instance there
is a service for searching and another one for recommendations. In
the end the individual services are presented together in the UI.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">There is always one team responsible for one service. The team takes
care of developing new features as well as of operating the service. The
idea is: “You build it – you run it!”</li>
  <li class="calibre14">The Cloud platform i.e. virtual machines constitute the common foundation
of all services. Apart from that there are no further standards. Thus
the teams are very free in their choice of technologies.</li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre3">By introducing this type of architecture Amazon implemented
fundamental characteristics of Microservices already in 2006. Moreover
Amazon introduced DevOps by having teams consisting of operation
experts and developers. This approach necessitates that the
deployments occur largely in an automated fashion as the manual
construction of servers is not feasible in Cloud environments – thus
Amazon also implemented at least one aspect of Continuous Delivery.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Conclusion: Microservices have been used by some companies for quite
some time already – especially by companies having an internet-based
business model. Thus the approach has already proven its practical
advantages in real life. In addition Microservices display synergy
effects with other modern approaches such as Continuous Delivery,
Cloud or DevOps.</p>

<h3 id="section3-2" class="calibre2">3.2 Developing a New Signaling System</h3>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-scenario-1" class="calibre15">Scenario</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Searching airplanes and ships which have gone missing is a complex
task. Rapid action can save lives. Therefore different systems are
required. Some provide signals such as radio or radar signals. These
signals have to be recorded and processed. Radio signals for example
can be used to obtain a bearing, which subsequently has to be checked
against radar-based pictures. Finally humans have to further evaluate
the information. The data analyses as well as the raw data have to be
provided to the different rescue teams. Signal inc. builds systems
for exactly these use cases. The systems are individually assembled,
configured and adapted to the specific needs of the respective client.</p>


<figure id="Fig4" class="image">
  <img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="Fig. 4: Overview of the Signaling System" class="calibre17"/>
  <figcaption class="calibre18">Fig. 4: Overview of the Signaling System</figcaption>
</figure>


<h5 id="leanpub-auto-reasons-to-use-microservices-1" class="calibre15">Reasons to Use Microservices</h5>

<p class="calibre3">The system is composed of different components, which run on different
computers. The sensors are distributed all over the area to be
monitored and are provided with their own servers. However, these
computers are not supposed to handle the more detailed data processing or to
store the data. Their hardware is not sufficiently powerful for that.
Besides data privacy considerations render such an approach very
undesirable as well.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-distributed-system" class="calibre15">Distributed System</h5>

<p class="calibre3">For these reasons the system has to be a distributed system. The different
functionalities are distributed within the network. The system is
unreliable as individual components and the communication between
components can fail.</p>

<p class="calibre3">It would be possible to implement a large part of the system within a
Deployment Monolith. However, upon closer consideration the different
parts of the system have to fulfill very different demands. Data
processing requires rather a lot of CPU and an approach that allows
numerous algorithms to process the data. For such purposes there are
solutions, which read events out of a data or event stream and process
them. Data storage requires a very different focus: Basically, the
data have to be maintained within a data structure, which is suitable
for different data analyses. Modern NoSQL databases are well suited
for this. Recent data are more important than old data. They have to
be accessible faster while old data can even be deleted at some point.
To be finally analyzed by experts the data have to be read from the
database and processed.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-technology-stack-per-team" class="calibre15">Technology Stack per Team</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Each of the discussed tasks poses different challenges. Consequently,
each requires not only a well adapted technology stack but also a
dedicated team consisting of technical experts for the respective
task. In addition people are needed who decide which features
Signal inc. will bring to the market and in line with that define new
requirements for the systems. Systems for processing and sensors are
individual products, which can be positioned on the market
independently of each other.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-integration-of-other-systems" class="calibre15">Integration of Other Systems</h5>

<p class="calibre3">An additional reason for the use of Microservices is the possibility
to easily integrate other systems. Sensors and computing units are also provided
by other companies. The ability to integrate such solutions is a
frequent requirement in client projects. Microservices allow the easy
integration of other systems as the integration of different
distributed components is anyhow a core feature of a
Microservices-based architecture.</p>

<p class="calibre3">For these reasons the architects of Signal inc. decided to indeed
implement their system as a distributed system. Each team must
implement its respective domain in several small Microservices. In
this way the exchangeability of the Microservices will be further
improved, and the integration of other systems will be even more
facilitated.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Only the communication infrastructure to be used by all services for
their communication with each other is predetermined. The
communication technology supports many programming languages and
platforms so that there are no limitations as to which concrete
technology is used. To allow for a flawless communication the
interfaces between the Microservices have to be clearly defined.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-challenges-2" class="calibre15">Challenges</h5>

<p class="calibre3">A failure of communication between the different
Microservices presents an important challenge. The system has to stay
useable even if network failures occur. This necessitates the use of
technologies, which can handle such failures. However, technologies
alone will not solve this problem. It has to be decided as part of the
user requirements what should happen if a system fails. If for
instance old data are sufficient, caches can be helpful. In addition
it can be possible to use a simpler algorithm, which does not require
calls to other systems.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-high-technological-complexity" class="calibre15">High Technological Complexity</h5>

<p class="calibre3">The technological complexity of the entire system is very high.
Different technologies are employed to fulfill the demands of the
different components. The teams working on the individual systems can
make largely independent technology decisions. This allows them to
always implement the most suitable solution.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Unfortunately, this means as well that developers can no longer change
easily between teams. For example when there was a lot of work for the
data storage team, developers from other teams could hardly help out as
they were not even proficient in the programming languages the data
storage team was using and did not know the specific technologies such
as the used database.</p>

<p class="calibre3">It certainly is a challenge to run a system comprising such a plethora
of technologies. For this reason there is one standardization in this
area: All Microservices must be able to be run in a largely identical
manner. They are virtual machines so that their installation is fairly
simple. Furthermore, the monitoring is standardized, which
determines data formats and technologies. This allows for the central
monitoring of the applications. In addition to the typical operational
monitoring there is also monitoring of application-specific values and finally an
analysis of log files.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-advantages-1" class="calibre15">Advantages</h5>

<p class="calibre3">In this context the main advantage offered by Microservices is the
good support for the distributed nature of the system. The sensors are
at different locations so that a centralized system is anyhow not
sensible. The architecture has adapted to this fact by further
dividing the system into small Microservices, which are distributed
within the network. This enhanced the exchangeability of the
Microservices. Besides the Microservices approach supports the
technology diversity, which characterizes this system.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In this scenario time-to-market is by far not as important as in the
other scenario. It would also be hard to implement as the systems are
installed at different clients and cannot be easily reinstalled.
However, some ideas from the Continuous Delivery field are used: For
instance the largely uniform installation and
the central monitoring.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-verdict" class="calibre15">Verdict</h5>

<p class="calibre3">Microservices are a very suitable architecture design for the
presented scenario. The system can profit from the fact that typical
problems can be solved during implementation by established approaches
from the Microservices field – for example technology complexity and
platform operation.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Still this scenario would hardly be immediately associated with the
term “Microservice”. This leads to the following conclusions:</p>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">Microservices have a wider application than is apparent at first
glance. Also outside of web-based business models Microservices can
solve many problems – even if those issues are very different from the
ones found in web companies.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">Indeed many projects from different fields have been using
Microservice-based approaches for quite some time,  even if they do
not call them by this name or implement them only partially.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">With the help of Microservices these projects can use technologies,
which are currently created in the Microservice field. In addition
they can profit from the experiences made in this field, for instance
in regards to architecture.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="section3-3" class="calibre2">3.3 Conclusion</h3>

<p class="calibre3">This chapter presented two very different scenarios from two
completely distinct business areas: a web system with a strong focus
on rapid time-to-market and a system for signal processing, which is
inherently distributed. The architecture principles are very similar
for the two systems although originating from different reasons.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In addition there are a number of common approaches, among those the
creation of teams according to Microservices, the demands in regards
to infrastructure automatization as well as other organizational
topics. However, in other areas there are also differences. For the
signaxsling system it is essential to have the possibility to use different
technologies as this system anyhow has to employ a number of different
technologies. For the web system this aspect is not as important.
Here, the independent development, the fast and easy deployment and
finally the better time-to-market are the decisive factors.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-essential-points" class="calibre15">Essential Points</h5>

<ul class="calibre16">
  <li class="calibre14">Microservices offer a plethora of advantages.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">In the case of web-based applications Continuous Delivery and short
time-to-market can constitute an important motivation for the use of
Microservices.</li>
  <li class="calibre14">However, there are also very different use cases for which
Microservices as distributed systems are extremely well suited.</li>
