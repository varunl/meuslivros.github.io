<h1>Afterword</h1>


<p>All good things come to an end, and so we must now end this book. We hope you have enjoyed it and found it useful.</p>

<p>We know we could have filled many more chapters as we peeled back the layers of OpenShift, but our intent with this book was to get you up and running with the latest version of OpenShift as quickly as possible. We hope you will continue to explore the seemingly neverending possibilities of what a modern container application platform such as OpenShift can provide.</p>

<h1>Final Words</h1>

<p>The whole ecosystem that exists around container based deployment is still a rapidly evolving area. Standardization of key components is occuring under the umbrella of the <a href="https://www.opencontainers.org">Open Container Initiative</a> overseen by the <a href="http://collabprojects.linuxfoundation.org">Linux Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>Even with the developing standards, there is still a large scope for products to distinguish themselves and offer unique functionality. To that end, the OpenShift team is commited to pushing the state of the art forward and provide you with a platform that we believe you will find compelling.</p>

<p>As we continue to develop OpenShift, check the OpenShift website and blog for the latest and greatest features. If you have suggestions for the platform you can always write to <a href="mailto:openshift@redhat.com">openshift@redhat.com</a> or provide feedback via the <a href="https://github.com/openshift/origin">OpenShift Origin</a> project.</p>

<p>One of the things we love about working with OpenShift is that the more you use it, the more possibilities emerge—so the most important thing at this point is for you to get coding!</p>
