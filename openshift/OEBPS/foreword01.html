<h1>Foreword</h1>

<p>Our industry is changing. It no longer matters what type of company you work for. It no longer matters what industry you are in. Software is becoming the tool on which the futures of our companies are built, both small and large.</p>

<p>At the center of this change is the evolution of software development itself. Open source development models have taken over. Agile practices are needed as the pace at which one needs to respond to competition or changes in the market is relentless. Linux containers have exploded onto the market as the new basis on which to build connections between development and operations. And harnessing infrastructure for your application, from public cloud to private infrastructure, is a necessity.</p>

<p>For some, it can feel like the pace of change is so fast that it’s better to not change at all. Having been lucky enough to participate in many of the aforementioned changes, I can assure you this is not a good position. Those who find the way to harness these changes are disrupting entire industries. It will soon be a necessity, not an option to chart your course.</p>

<p>When we set out to build OpenShift, this was our goal. We wanted a way for software developers to take their new idea and make it a reality. We wanted to bring them the latest technology to use to their advantage in a simple way so their energy could be focused on their idea. To be this guide for developers, we have also had to constantly evolve in support of this mission.</p>

<p>Grant Shipley has been at the center of our evolution. He has been our link to the developers and our guide in keeping our focus on our end users. His passion for open source and his passion for development come through in everything he does. I’ve watched as Grant has grown from a innovative software developer to an amazing speaker and champion of our product and mission. He’s done an inspiring job of capturing that spirit in this book and I truly thank him for continuing to drive us in our mission.</p>

<p>Graham Dumpleton has come to us from the Python developer community where he has been a key contributor in the area of Python web application deployment. He was the author of the Apache module called mod_wsgi, a popular choice among Python developers for deploying their web applications. Graham is using all that experience to help drive forward improvements in our support for Python in OpenShift as well as our build systems based around Source-to-Image (S2I).</p>

<p>They both bring a wealth of experience to this book and I hope it helps propel you to that next great idea.</p>
