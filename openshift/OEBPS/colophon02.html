  <p>The animal on the cover of <em>OpenShift for Developers</em> is a <em>black-headed caique</em> (<em>Pionites melanocephalus</em>), also known as the black-headed or black-capped parrot. They inhabit mostly humid forest areas in the Amazon (north of the Amazon River), Brazil (to the west of the Ucayali River), northern Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.</p>

<p>The black-headed caique is medium-small with a short tail, black crown, yellow-orangeish head, white belly, yellow thighs, and green wings, back, and upper tail. Males and females have identical plumage; the only way to determine gender is through surgical sexing or DNA sexing—DNA sexing is much safer for the birds than the former. Wild caiques often have a brownish stained breast that is white on captive birds. </p>

<p>Black-headed caiques are often found in pairs or small flocks of up to 10 birds (sometimes up to 30). They mostly eat flowers, pulp, seeds, and possibly insects. The two subspecies of the black-headed caique—<em>P.m. melanocephalus</em> and <em>P.m. pallidus</em>—hybridize freely and often have similar coloring.</p>

<p>These birds are popular among parrot breeders and keepers. They make for energetic pets and require large cages filled with toys and perches. The minimum cage size recommended is 24'' L	× 24'' W	× 36'' H with a maximum bar spacing of 1''. Black-headed parrots use their beaks more than other parrot species and tend to bite. They mimic human speech poorly, often mimicking other sounds such as alarms, smoke detectors, microwave beeps, laughs, and whistles. Caiques also combine sounds in their vocabulary to form new sounds.</p>
