<h1><span class="label">Chapter 3. </span>Installing the All-in-One VM</h1>


<p>For the exercises in this book we will be using a virtual machine (VM) that has all the pieces of an OpenShift server already installed and configured. This machine will be routable from your local system so you can treat it like a hosted version of OpenShift and can view the URLs you create.</p>

<p>This image is based off of <a href="https://github.com/openshift/origin">OpenShift Origin</a> and is a fully functioning OpenShift instance with an integrated Docker registry. The aim of this project is to allow web developers and other interested parties to run OpenShift V3 on their own computer. The VM is configured by default to have a separate IP address (10.2.2.2) from your local machine, and it includes a network configuration that assigns each new container deployed on the platform its own unique IP address. This gives the illusion that the VM is running on separate hardware in a data center or public cloud while in fact it’s running locally on your machine.</p>

<p>The OpenShift master, node, Docker registry, and other pieces run on one VM. Given its focus on application developers, it should NOT be used in production. While the Vagrantfile only specifies 2 gigs of RAM, you can edit the file to increase this setting if you want to run more containers concurrently in your instance.</p>

<p>The VM uses <a href="https://xip.io">xip.io</a> to provide DNS resolution with application URLs. The advantage of this is that you actually get routable URLs to your local machine without browser or Vagrant plug-ins that may not work on your machine. The drawback is that you need to be online whenever you use the VM and xip.io may be blocked by your company’s firewalls. We apologize in advance if this happens. Our only suggestion is to either try to work on a different network, talk to your admin about opening up xip.io, or try the <a href="https://github.com/phinze/landrush">Landrush plug-in</a> for Vagrant.</p>
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>
<p>Since we wanted developers to be able to use any Docker image they want, we had to turn off some security in OpenShift. By default, OpenShift will not allow a container to run as root or even a nonrandom container assigned userid. Most Docker images in the Dockerhub do not follow this best practice and instead run as root. Furthermore, a large majority of Dockerhub images are not patched for well-known vulnerabilities. Therefore, use images from Docker Hub with caution. We think some of the risk is mitigated because you are running OpenShift in a VM, but still—be careful about which Docker images you run.</p>

<p>While we will go through the install instructions here, the latest install instructions and information can be found on the <a href="https://openshift.org/vm">OpenShift.org VM page</a>.</p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Software Requirements"><div class="sect1" id="idm140645243141216">
<h1>Software Requirements</h1>

<p>You only need a couple of things on your system to run the all-in-one image: Vagrant, VirtualBox, and the <code>oc</code> command-line tool.</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Install VirtualBox"><div class="sect2" id="idm140645243138944">
<h2>Install VirtualBox</h2>

<p>The OpenShift all-in-one image uses the VirtualBox as the virtualization system. You are probably wondering why we chose VirtualBox instead of other tools. We chose it for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It is cross-platform, allowing Mac, Windows, and Linux users use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is free and open source, allowing everyone freedom as in beer and as in speech when choosing the virtualization tool.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Download the correct package for your operating system from the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox download page</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have it downloaded, follow the instructions on the VirtualBox site to install the software.</p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Install Vagrant"><div class="sect2" id="idm140645243133088">
<h2>Install Vagrant</h2>

<p>Vagrant is a software tool that allows users to create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments. It works in conjunction with virtualization (both VMs and IaaS) to automate all the steps necessary to get your dev environment going. You probably already have Vagrant installed on your system, but if you don’t simply head over to the <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">download page</a> and follow the instructions for your operating system.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>For Linux systems, is it recommended that you install via the package manager provided by your distribution.  For example, to install Vagrant on Fedora 23, issue the following command:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="shell"><code class="nv">$ </code>sudo dnf install vagrant</pre>
</div>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Vagrant init"><div class="sect2" id="idm140645243012304">
<h2>Vagrant init</h2>

<p>The last thing we need to download is the <a href="https://www.openshift.org/vm/Vagrantfile">Vagrantfile</a>, which tells Vagrant what type of system we want to download as well as some configuration information.</p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Change Your Memory Configuration"><div class="sect2" id="idm140645244188928">
<h2>Change Your Memory Configuration</h2>

<p>The last thing you may want to do is customize the amount of memory that you want the OpenShift container application platform to use.  By default, the Vagrantfile will allocate 4 GB of memory for the platform, but you may want to change this depending on your specific needs.  For example, my development rig has 32 GB of memory (yeah, I am bragging a bit here) so I like to allocate 16 GB.  The relevant line you want to change in the Vagrantfile is:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="ruby"><code class="n">vb</code><code class="o">.</code><code class="n">memory</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"4096"</code></pre>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Start Things Up"><div class="sect2" id="idm140645243029792">
<h2>Start Things Up</h2>

<p>The last thing we need to do is start up the platform.  To do this, ensure you are in the directory where your Vagrantfile is located and issue the following command:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="shell"><code class="nv">$ </code>vagrant up --provider<code class="o">=</code>virtualbox</pre>

<p>BAM!</p>

<p>At this point, the all-in-one image will be downloaded so be patient as it depends on your Internet connection.</p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Download the Latest oc Command-Line Tool"><div class="sect2" id="idm140645243071488">
<h2>Download the Latest oc Command-Line Tool</h2>

<p>OpenShift 3 allows you to work from the command line, web console, or via the Eclipse IDE using the latest JBoss tools.  However, we are going to focus on using the command-line tool and the web console here.  The oc tool is a single executable that is written in the Go programming language.  For this reason, there is actually nothing to install.  You simply need to download the tool and add it to your PATH.  Sounds easy, right?  Well, it is for OS X and Linux users, but Windows users will need to hunt around a bit to change the system path.  Let’s start with downloading the toolset.  The only real requirement for the <code>oc</code> tool is that you are using a 64-bit operating system. The <a href="https://openshift.org/vm">VM instruction</a> page has links to the appropriate version of the <code>oc</code> command-line tool based on the version of the VM you are using.</p>

<p>Once you have the tool downloaded, extract the contents and add the oc executable to your PATH.  For example, if I extracted the contents to the cli directory in my home directory, I would issue the following command in both Linux and OS X:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="shell"><code class="nv">$ </code><code class="nb">export </code><code class="nv">PATH</code><code class="o">=</code><code class="nv">$PATH</code>:~/cli/</pre>
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h1>Windows</h1>
<p>Changing your PATH in Windows varies by OS version but the general workflow is to right-click your computer name inside of File Explorer, and select Advanced system settings (I guess changing your PATH is considered an advanced task?)</p>
</div>

<p>Click the Advanced tab and then click Environment variables. Once the new dialog opens, select the Path variable and add “;C:\CLI” at the end (ensure you replace C:\CLI with the location of where you extracted the tool). You could also just copy it to C:\Windows or a directory you know is already on your path. For more detailed instructions, by operating system:</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Initial Login from the Web Console"><div class="sect1" id="idm140645243109840">
<h1>Initial Login from the Web Console</h1>

<p>Now that we have everything in place let’s go ahead and log in as the admin on the box so we can do one last preparatory step. The VM has no set users and passwords so you can create your usernames and passwords as you go along:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to the web console for your OpenShift instance: <a href="https://10.2.2.2:8443"><em class="hyperlink">https://10.2.2.2:8443</em></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the login prompt type <strong><code>admin</code></strong> for the user and <strong><code>password</code></strong> for the password, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig0301">Figure 3-1</a>.</p>

<figure><div id="fig0301" class="figure">

<h6><span class="label">Figure 3-1. </span>Use admin for the username and password for the password when prompted</h6>
</div></figure>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should see a screen listing all the projects available to the admin user. We will discuss some of these projects later in the book, but for now, click the <em>openshift-infra</em> project, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig0302">Figure 3-2</a>.</p>

<figure><div id="fig0302" class="figure">
<img src="assets/osfd_03in02.png" alt="osfd 03in02"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 3-2. </span>Select the openshift-infra project</h6>
</div></figure>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside this project you will see a service and a route:</p>

<p><em><a href="https://hawkular-metrics.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io">hawkular-metrics.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io</a></em></p>

<p>Go ahead and click that link. If you get a browser warning go ahead and accept the certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we can go ahead and log out as admin and log in as a user without the cluttered project view (see <a data-type="xref" href="#fig0303">Figure 3-3</a>).</p>

<figure><div id="fig0303" class="figure">

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Now Log In from the Command Line"><div class="sect1" id="idm140645242991104">
<h1>Now Log In from the Command Line</h1>

<p>Let’s go ahead and log in as a normal user using the command-line tools:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="shell"><code class="nv">$ </code>oc login https://10.2.2.2:8443

Authentication required <code class="k">for</code> https://10.2.2.2:8443 <code class="o">(</code>openshift<code class="o">)</code>

Login successful.

You don<code class="err">'</code>t have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    <code class="nv">$ </code>oc new-project &lt;projectname&gt;</pre>

<p>As noted earlier, you can create any username and password; we use <em>user:password</em> in our examples. For now, do not create a new project; we will do this in the next chapter.</p>
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>
<p>In Windows, the command-line tool will not let you log in due to the self-signed certificate for the server. You need to log in passing a flag to tell the command-line tools to ignore the self-signed cert:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="shell"> oc login https://10.2.2.2:8443
 --insecure-skip-tls-verify<code class="o">=</code><code class="nb">true</code></pre>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Now Log In to the Web Console as a Normal User"><div class="sect1" id="idm140645242981648">
<h1>Now Log In to the Web Console as a Normal User</h1>

<p>Now let’s bring the experience full circle by logging in as the same user in the web console. You already logged in on the web console a couple of steps above, so just do the same thing except use the normal username and password we used previously. You should see a screen like this the one in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig0304">Figure 3-4</a>.</p>

<figure><div id="fig0304" class="figure">

<h6><span class="label">Figure 3-4. </span>OpenShift welcome screen</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Again, we’re not going to create a project right now. On to our final step.</p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Create a GitHub Account"><div class="sect1" id="idm140645242970848">
<h1>Create a GitHub Account</h1>

<p>Finally, to make things easier here in terms of code and exchanging ideas, you need to sign up for a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> account. You will use this to fork code and to make it easier to builds in OpenShift.  If you don’t already have an account go ahead and create one (see <a data-type="xref" href="#fig0305">Figure 3-5</a>).</p>

<figure><div id="fig0305" class="figure">
<img src="assets/osfd_03in05.png" alt="osfd 03in05"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 3-5. </span>Create an account if you don’t have one</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>GitHub supports using two-factor authentication (TFA) for your account and we strongly recommend you use it. TFA means that in addition to your normal password, a second factor is required to log in (usually a random code generated every minute or so on your phone). We have had two different online accounts saved from being hacked by using TFA. To turn on TFA, go to your settings (the icon at the top-right of your GitHub page, go to Security, and then turn on two-factor authentication, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig0306">Figure 3-6</a>.</p>

<figure><div id="fig0306" class="figure">
<img src="assets/osfd_03in06.png" alt="osfd 03in06"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 3-6. </span>Turn on two-factor authentication</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>The system will walk you through a few steps to enable it. While it may seem like a bit of a hassle, you will thank us someday (or not because you never notice <em>not</em> being hacked).</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Summary"><div class="sect1" id="idm140645242857072">
<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>In this chapter, we set up your local machine so you have a working instance of OpenShift running and ready to interact with. You also got a chance to log in, do some easy configuration, and finally set up a GitHub account for your code. At this point you are probably thinking, “When do I actually get to work on code?!?” Well, the time has come—from now it is all hands-on development work with OpenShift.</p>
